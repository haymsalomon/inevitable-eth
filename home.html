<p>Ethereum is like religion: you cannot make a logical argument and convince someone to believe, you can only give them sacred truths and wait for them to experience enlightenment.</p>
<p>In May 2021, I had my epiphany when I heard <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hayden-adams-explains-uniswap-and-the-rise-of-defi/id1056200096?i=1000520421257">Hayden Adams explain Uniswap</a>. In a single podcast episode, I went from “internet dollars for internet dollars sake” to “the next inevitable, obvious step in thousands of years of human innovation.”</p>
<p>A giant leap forward.</p>
<p>This is a project dedicated to Ethereum, the World Computer. None of us can force the conversion moment on another person; it’s just not how this works. But some day, every single person is going to have their Hayden Adams-moment. This project is for that moment in every new convert’s journey.</p>
<p>Or, more specifically, for the moments right after.</p>
<p>The goal: create the materials to take your spark of interest and grow it into an all consuming fire. To give the builders and other zealots the information they need to understand the whole picture, big and small.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To show you the future that humanity is working towards; that we’ve been working towards every since we climbed down from the trees and stood upright.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To show you that Ethereum is not only a big deal…</p>
<p>Ethereum is inevitable.</p>
