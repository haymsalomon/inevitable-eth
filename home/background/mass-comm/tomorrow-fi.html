<h2>HTTPS</h2>
<p>Take a look at the top of your browser, click on the box on the top. Look at the first 5 letters: https.</p>
<p>All you need to know about https - it is the method by which computers communicate behind the scenes to deliver the internet experience you know and love.</p>
<p>From the perspective of 99.9% of humanity (including the vast majority of developers), you never need to know or care what happens under the hood of https.</p>
<p>All you care about is that given a web address, https can deliver content of arbitrary kind and size.</p>
<h2>Building before the Foundation Sets</h2>
<p>Now, imagine you are Mark Zuckerberg, and you have this vision for a sleazy, gather-all-the-photos-of-our-female-classmates-so-we-can-rate-them website.</p>
<p>Let’s say you want to deploy your proto-Facebook onto the internet…</p>
<p>...but let’s say that https isn’t finished.</p>
<p>In fact, far from being finished, it’s in the middle of some transformational changes.</p>
<p>Changes that not only change how information flows through the system, but radically reshape the purpose of https and, by extension, the entire internet.</p>
<p>How far would you get building Facebook in those conditions?</p>
<p>How big can you build your legacy on a foundation that hasn’t finished setting?</p>
<p>This is how you should understand the current state of Ethereum.</p>
<h2>Background Technology</h2>
<p>In 2030+, you will experience Ethereum the same way you experience https now. You’ll see glimpses, maybe a 0x or .eth address, but you’ll never really need to think about it.</p>
<p>As Ethereum fades into the background, it will be the foundation for internet-native property.</p>
<p>In 2023, Ethereum provides exactly this: credibly neutral settlement, guaranteed by a decentralized network of untrusted computers.</p>
<p>But it’s very difficult to access, slow, risky and expensive.</p>
<p>It’s very easy to wonder how empires are going to be built on Ethereum.</p>
<p>It’s very easy to wonder how nation-states will dissolve in the glory of the World Computer.</p>
<p>But, then again, imagine if we were at the point where all https could do was send 100 ASCII characters back and forth.</p>
<p>Would you have been able to imagine Facebook?</p>
<h2>Lessons from the Past</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, my friends, peering into the future is a fool’s task; there’s no telling what Ethereum will enable. But while we are here making this point, we might as well drive it home.</p>
<p>And so, I’ll ask you to consider the greater Ethereum ecosystem we have today.</p>
<p>AMMs, collateralized lending protocols, stablecoins, oracles, rollups, bridges, DAOs, NFTs, let’s even throw in all the centralized exchanges, crypto banks and other institutions.</p>
<p>Everything you think of when I say “Ethereum” in 2023.</p>
<p>Let’s call it “Today-Fi.”</p>
<h2>Ethereum Whitepaper</h2>
<p>Back in 2014 at Bitcoin Miami, a 20 year old <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9dpjN3Mwps">Vitalik Buterin explained that Bitcoin could be expanded to a Turning-complete blockchain computer</a>.</p>
<p>Many would see Vitalik’s proposed Ethereum as a betrayal of the fundamental principles of crypto.</p>
<p>Would you have been able to see Today-Fi?</p>
<p>Maybe you would have stuck around through the ICO and the 2015 launch to make it all the way to July 2016 and THE Decentralized Autonomous Organization.</p>
<h2>The DAO Hack</h2>
<p>Before DAOs, there was the DAO, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVC9SbTmfSg">a single entity around which the entire community rallied</a>.</p>
<p>About 15% of all ETH (more than currently staked) was sent to the DAO… and then the DAO was hacked.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the hacker had to wait 28 days before he had access to the funds, and so the community was able to coordinate and deploy a hard fork, undoing the damage.</p>
<p>Would you have been able to see Today-Fi?</p>
<h2>The Shanghai Attacks</h2>
<p>Or how about shortly later, in fall of 2016, in the middle of Devcon 2 (held in Shanghai).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhr5nlMNvRQ">An attacker had found a way to completely freeze the Ethereum network</a> and thereby break a core promise of Ethereum: 100% uptime.</p>
<p>Fortunately, many of the core devs were all staying at the same hotel and were able to gather in the same physical space to answer the attack.</p>
<p>This began a 2+ month long back and forth, threatening the very existence of the World Computer.</p>
<p>A first hard fork in October slowed (but did not stop) the attacker.</p>
<p>Eventually, the attack was halted with a final hard fork on November 22, 2016 and Ethereum has never seen a successful DDOS attack since.</p>
<p>Would you have been able to see Today-Fi?</p>
<h2>Progress Cycles&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Bull markets, bear markets, ICO mania, De-Fi summer, NFTs, the rise and fall of the alternate L1s, everything has built and built and built and then crashed all over itself.</p>
<p>But each time, we learn from the mistakes of last time and build a more sophisticated Ethereum.</p>
<p>So here we are, sitting in the depths of the bear market.</p>
<p>It's been a year since we felt true euphoria, since then it's been a lot of pain. We’re waiting in dread as we wait for SBF’s gifts to unwind. And Uncle Sam is finally turning his angry attention towards crypto.</p>
<p>Are you able to see Tomorrow-Fi?</p>
