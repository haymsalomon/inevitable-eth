<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<h3>Application Programming Interfaces</h3>
<p><a href="/home/concepts/api">Application Programming Interfaces</a> (APIs) are the mechanism by which programs communicate and developers coordinate.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ethereum Token Standards</h3>
<p>Think of the different token types as a piece of code that conforms to an API template.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="/home/ethereum/blockchain/token-standards">If a smart contract adheres to a specific template, it is that kind of token</a>.</p>
<h2>The World Computer</h2>
<p>Ethereum is the <a href="https://inevitableeth.com/home/ethereum/world-computer">World Computer</a>, a single, globally shared computing platform that exists in the space between a network of 1,000s of computers (<a href="https://inevitableeth.com/home/ethereum/network/node">nodes</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nodes provide the hardware, the <a href="https://inevitableeth.com/home/ethereum/evm">Ethereum Virtual Machine</a> (EVM) provides the <a href="https://inevitableeth.com/home/concepts/virtual-machine">virtual computer</a> and the <a href="https://inevitableeth.com/home/ethereum/blockchain">blockchain</a> records Ethereum's history.</p>
<p>The Ethereum Network provides <a href="/home/concepts/credible-neutrality">credible neutrality</a> upon which anyone can build... both independently and collaboratively.</p>
<h2>Composable Building</h2>
<p>Any developer can deploy (nearly) anything on-chain. Arbitrary applications are very difficult to integrate, and so the community has developed a set of token standards.</p>
<p>Each token standard was created to allow Ethereum applications (and therefore assets) to express more and different properties.</p>
<p>From ERC-20 (basic accounting and transfer) to ERC-4246 (deposit and accrue value), each successive standard builds upon the previous.</p>
<p>And now, we have our newest Ethereum token standard: ERC-3475, the bond token standard.</p>
<h2>ERC-3475</h2>
<p><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3475">ERC-3475</a> is a new, multi-layered structure that allows an asset to issue and service debt without fracturing liquidity.</p>
<p>Bond: a borrower receives money and commits to returning it on a certain date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ERC-3475 functions the same way, it can issue bonds, each with their own supply, redemption conditions and metadata.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All enforced by smart contract.</p>
<p>This new debt management layer will directly issue and service bonds, including bonds of different classes (fixed vs floating) and maturities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All built on an ERC-20-like foundational layer that holds the underlying value.</p>
<p>It is critically important to understand the two-layer nature of ERC-3475, because while all the intricacies are in the bond layer, the real benefits are in the (foundational) value layer.</p>
<h2>Bonds in De-Fi</h2>
<p>Bonds are not a new concept to De-Fi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a Trad-Fi background, you probably ran into the concept in the form fixed/variable rate protocols like <a href="https://www.element.fi/">Element Finance</a>, <a href="https://www.notional.finance/">Notional Finance</a> or <a href="https://www.apwine.fi/">APWine</a>.</p>
<p>And yet, the space is a small shadow of its real world counterpart.</p>
<p>The issue with De-Fi bonds boils down to <a href="/home/concepts/liquidity">liquidity</a> and complexity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each time a protocol issues a new bond it must issue an individual ERC-20 token.</p>
<p>It must not only service the bond, any overlapping bonds cannot share liquidity and funds cannot be rolled over after expiry</p>
<p>ERC-3475 is the solution to this on the protocol layer... the actually-touching-the-chain layer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It provides the templating to create modern bonding system at the money-lego-level.</p>
<p>This is what programmable money looks like in 2022, just 2 years after the birth of De-Fi.</p>
<p>Just imagine year 10.</p>
<p>Now imagine year 100.</p>
