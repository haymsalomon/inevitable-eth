<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<h3>Prereq 1</h3>
<p>Lorem ipsum</p>
<h2>The World Computer</h2>
<p>Ethereum exists between a network of 1,000s of computers (<a href="https://inevitableeth.com/home/ethereum/network/node">nodes</a>), each running a local version of the <a href="https://inevitableeth.com/home/ethereum/evm">Ethereum Virtual Machine</a> (EVM). All copies of the EVM are kept perfectly in sync.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any individual EVM is a window into the shared state of the <a href="https://inevitableeth.com/home/ethereum/world-computer">World Computer</a>.</p>
<h2>APIs</h2>
<p><a href="/home/concepts/api">Application Programming Interfaces</a> (APIs) are the mechanism by which programs communicate and developers coordinate.</p>
<p>A developer will camouflage as much of the inner workings of their program as much as possible. Communication is maximally simplified and streamlined.</p>
<p>On the World Computer, we use APIs all over the place:</p>
<ul>
  <li>to integrate protocols</li>
  <li>to transfer assets</li>
  <li>to build composable investments</li>
  <li>to borrow, lend and collateralize assets</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically anything that happens on chain is either an API or is directly summarized by an API</p>
<h2>Token Standards</h2>
<p>In fact, you can think of the different <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/">token types</a> as a piece of code that conforms to an API template.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a smart contract adheres to a specific template, it is that kind of token.</p>
<p>This is the template for an ERC-20 token.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/token-standards-2.jpeg"></figure>
<p>In order to create an ERC-20, a developer has to create code to be executed for all of these methods and events&nbsp;</p>
<p>All ERC-20s support these functions; a (different) developer can count on having these when using any ERC-20.</p>
<h3>ERC-20</h3>
<p><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20">ERC-20</a> tokens are the most basic token standard, representing the vast majority of tokens available today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This includes everything from governance tokens, ve-tokens, stablecoins, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ETH is not an ERC-20 token, or a token at all. ETH is something special. <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-wrapped-ether-weth-and-how-to-wrap-it">In order to use ETH in De-Fi, we generally need to use WETH</a>.</p>
<h3>ERC-721</h3>
<p><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3386">ERC-721</a> tokens are most commonly referred to as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens).&nbsp;</p>
<p>These tokens represent unique or identifiable items (usually) within a collection. This includes PFPs, collectable art, property, etc.</p>
<h3>ERC-1155</h3>
<p><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3386">ERC-1155</a> tokens combine properties of both ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, providing a single interface that manages any combination of these token types.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This can be used as a more modern alternative for ERC-20 or ERC-721, and has unique properties optimized for gaming.</p>
<h3>ERC-4626</h3>
<p><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626">ERC-4626</a> is a newer token standard, describing yield-bearing vaults.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The standard provides a common interface for ERC-20 tokens deposited in (or redeemed from) a vault to earn yield. This can include yield farming and aggregation, but can be generalized to much more.</p>
<h3>ERC-777</h3>
<p><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777">ERC-777</a> is a very configurable but rarely used token standard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It provides updates to ERC-20, allowing devs to attach code that runs when the token is sent and/or received.</p>
<p>Although it is included on the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/">Ethereum Foundation official list</a>, we rarely see ERC - 777 tokens in practice.</p>
<h3>ERC-3475</h3>
<p><a href="/home/ethereum/blockchain/token-standards/erc-3475">Deep Dive: ERC-3475</a></p>
<p><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3475">ERC-3475</a> is the latest ERC token standard, becoming official August 24th, 2022.</p>
<p>ERC-3475 is the bond token standard, a new, multi-layered structure that allows an asset to issue and service debt without fracturing liquidity.</p>
<h2>Composability</h2>
<p>Quick history lesson:</p>
<p>First, The Before Time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then... Alan Turing → mechanical computing → <a href="/home/background/mass-comm/computer">computers</a> → networked computers → ARPANET→ World Wide Web → Internet → Bitcoin&nbsp;</p>
<p>That brings us to roughly 2014, when VitalikButerin introduced us to ETH.</p>
<p>This is the beginning of the story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ethereum is just the infrastructure, now we must build on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The more we set standards at the foundation, the higher we can go</p>
<p>Computer science is the magic, the developers are the wizards, abstraction is the spell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Composability is the goal.</p>
