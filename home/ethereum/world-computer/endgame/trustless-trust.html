<h1 style="text-align:center;">Trustless Trust</h1>
<h2>The World Computer</h2>
<p>Ethereum is the <a href="https://inevitableeth.com/home/ethereum/world-computer">World Computer</a>, a network of 1,000s of computers (<a href="https://inevitableeth.com/home/ethereum/network/node">nodes</a>) coordinating using <a href="https://inevitableeth.com/home/ethereum/network/consensus/pos">Proof of Stake</a> (PoS) to keep the <a href="https://inevitableeth.com/home/ethereum/evm">Ethereum Virtual Machine</a> (EVM) in sync.</p>
<p>The EVM is the shared computing platform, the blockchain its history and ETH its lifeblood.</p>
<p>This "network of nodes" is the foundation upon which Ethereum ultimately derives its value. The more decentralized, the more value.</p>
<p>From decentralization comes <a href="https://inevitableeth.com/home/concepts/credible-neutrality">credible neutrality</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without credible neutrality, we might as well be using FB-dollaroos in Farmville-DeFi.</p>
<h2>Accessing Ethereum</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="/access-ethereum-1.jpeg"></figure>
<p><a href="/home/ethereum/network/node/accessing-ethereum">Deep Dive: Accessing Ethereum</a></p>
<p>Today, Ethereum is decently decentralized and super not scalable... by design. Raising the minimum requirements of a node increases scalability at the cost of decentralization.</p>
<p>Put another way, if we want to increase decentralization, we need to sacrifice execution*.</p>
<p>Because here's the thing: running a node, the one and only way to access Ethereum, is kind of a big deal. It requires dedicated (high end) hardware, unlimited bandwidth and constant maintenance.</p>
<p>The reality is that it is too big a task for 99% of the population.</p>
<h2>A Centralized Bridge-Solution</h2>
<p>There are currently about ~10k nodes, meaning there are ~10k access points into Ethereum.</p>
<p>But the VAST majority of all requests flow through just a few specific nodes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Platforms like <a href="https://www.alchemy.com/">Alchemy</a> allow users to interact with their nodes over an internet API.</p>
<p>Left unchecked, this centralization dynamic could threaten Ethereum. Why bother growing the network if the only way anyone can realistically access it is via 2 centralized, private entities?</p>
<p>Node-as-a-Service is a bridge solution; we need to scale direct access.</p>
<p>In order to achieve the Ethereum endgame, Ethereum must support light clients - software that can directly, independently access (and cryptographically verify) Ethereum.</p>
<h2>Light Clients</h2>
<p>In order to get there we need to develop two big concepts: statelessness and the Portal Network.</p>
<h3>Stateless Ethereum</h3>
<p><a href="/home/ethereum/upgrades/statelessness">Deep Dive: The Road to Stateless Ethereum</a></p>
<p>Today, the <a href="/home/ethereum/evm/state-machine">internal state</a> of Ethereum requires ~500 GB to store locally.</p>
<p>A stateless Ethereum will allow anyone to access its state without actually storing it, instead allowing users to directly and independently prove they are securely interacting with it.</p>
<p>Light clients need statelessness, but statelessness isn't enough.</p>
<h3>The Portal Network</h3>
<figure class="image"><img src="/light-client-1.jpeg"></figure>
<p><a href="/home/ethereum/upgrades/light-clients">Deep Dive: Portal Network</a></p>
<p>In order to directly interact with Ethereum, users need data to verify the cryptographic proofs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of asking the nodes to process these (increasing node's work), we will turn to the Portal Network.</p>
<h3>Light Clients</h3>
<p>So, statelessness + Portal Network = light clients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this world, a light client would power on, be able to sync with Ethereum instantly (currently &gt; a day) and immediately begin transacting.</p>
<p>All possible with minimal hardware and a mediocre internet connection.</p>
<h2>Trustless Trust</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="/trustless-trust-2.png"></figure>
<p><a href="/home/ethereum/world-computer/internet-settlement">Deep Dive: Internet Native Settlement</a></p>
<p>Light clients are really, really big. Ever thought about why De-Fi/NFTs are like the only things being built? It's because accessing the EVM is so hard that once you're within you need to stay there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A world where trustless access is trivial has infinite possibility.</p>
<p>And really that's what this is all about: trust, or more specifically, the ability to interact and coordinate without relying on trust at all.</p>
<p>Ethereum provides the way for the internet to <a href="/home/ethereum/evm/property-rights">trustlessly express ownership</a>, light clients will allow trustless interaction.</p>
<p>Trustless is a strange concept; it's the idea that if you can independently verify everything about a system, there is no need for trust in the first place.</p>
<p>The entire project is about creating this trustless trust.</p>
<h2>The Collateral of Trustless Trust</h2>
<p><a href="/home/ethereum/network/consensus/pos">Deep Dive: Proof of Stake</a></p>
<p>Trusting in Ethereum ultimately means trusting the Ethereum node operators... and node operators are real people with human motivations.</p>
<p>So Ethereum issues ETH and coordinates around Proof of Stake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No need to trust intentions, you just need to trust the economics.</p>
<p>Proof of Stake is crypto's method of transforming a trust assumption into an economic one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You don't have to trust a node operator, you just need to know that acting in bad faith is INCREDIBLY expensive... more expensive than it could ever be worth.</p>
<p><a href="https://ultrasound.money/">You've heard of ETH as ultra sound money</a>?&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's only part of the story.</p>
<p>In the Ethereum endgame, ETH isn't just the most decentralized monetary asset, it has a uniquely Ethereum property:</p>
<p>ETH is the currency of trustless trust.</p>
<h2>The Middleware Goldrush</h2>
<p><a href="/home/ethereum/upgrades/middleware">Deep Dive: Ethereum Middleware</a></p>
<p>The path forward is already clear, the Middleware Gold Rush is inevitable.</p>
<p>Just like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Gold_Rush">California Gold Rush of 1849 began when James Marshall found gold at Sutter's Mill</a>, the Ethereum Middleware Gold Rush will begin when <a href="https://twitter.com/sreeramkannan">Sreeram Kannan</a> launches <a href="/home/ethereum/upgrades/middleware/eigenlayer">EigenLayer</a> on mainnet.</p>
<p>Tl;dr EigenLayer allows a node to re-stake its staked ETH in order to use its excess computational capacity to provide trustless services.</p>
<p>Instead of a new PoS network for every trust assumption, ETH will become the asset of trustless trust.</p>
<p>Need some examples? Let's say we want to monitor the rapidly changing oceans.</p>
<h3>Trustless Sensors</h3>
<figure class="image"><img src="/trustless-trust-3.jpeg"></figure>
<p>We can deploy 1000s of sensors with embedded light clients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These sensors can trustlessly post data directly to Ethereum, which will be backed by the economic guarantees of re-staked $ETH.</p>
<h3>Driverless Cars</h3>
<figure class="image"><img src="/trustless-trust-4.png"></figure>
<p>Let's look at a transportation; imagine embedding light clients into a car.</p>
<p>The car will be able to trustlessly verify everything around it.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Which cars can be trusted as a driverless car?&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Which garages can be opened?&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Who and when can a company charge for a service?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Asset Tracking</h3>
<figure class="image"><img src="/trustless-trust-5.jpeg"></figure>
<p>Last one, think about container ships.</p>
<p>Today, each one is simply a box of metal with a barcode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Logistics is super intense and sensitive data must be shared with non-sensitive parties.</p>
<p>In a light client, re-staked world, trustless secure logistics becomes trivial.</p>
<h2>Scaling Ethereum</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="/scaling-1.jpeg"></figure>
<p><a href="/home/ethereum/upgrades/scaling">Deep Dive: Scaling Ethereum Execution</a></p>
<p>This is the endgame for Ethereum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything we are doing is to transform ETH into the most pristine asset a human could ever ask for: the currency of trustless trust.</p>
<p>Need some more convincing? Let's go back to the old way we used to talk about Ethereum scaling.</p>
<h3>Scaling Transaction Throughput</h3>
<p><a href="/home/ethereum/upgrades/scaling/execution">Deep Dive: Rollups</a></p>
<p>Previously, the most important way we talked about scaling Ethereum was by increasing the number of transactions we could execute through the EVM.</p>
<p>Rollups are a paradigm change; instead of using the EVM to execute, we execute elsewhere and simply settle on Ethereum.</p>
<p>Settlement is the point where ownership is decided, and so the rollup paradigm works by posting the final result of any transaction to mainnet.</p>
<h3>Scaling Data Availability</h3>
<p><a href="/home/ethereum/upgrades/scaling/data">Deep Dive: Danksharding</a></p>
<p>Danksharding will introduce data blobs that DRASTICALLY increase the capacity for these receipts (and therefore Ethereum's throughput).</p>
<p>Rollups are settling to Ethereum, posting their data to blobs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This data is inaccessible to the EVM, it's only important that it is posted to a shard and its data is made available to those outside the EVM.</p>
<p>Well... in the Ethereum Endgame, the EVM is stateless.</p>
<h2>The EVM Shard</h2>
<p>Here's the question for you, dear reader:</p>
<p>What is the difference between a rollup and stateless EVM?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both simply post blobs of data to Ethereum shards that the beacon chain/PoS don't care about.</p>
<p>The answer: A stateless EVM is really just another shard.</p>
<h2>Trustless Trust</h2>
<p>Ethereum is and always will be the World Computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today it is a slow, difficult to use computer; fortunately the path to 100k transactions/second is clear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we did not build the World Computer for performance. We built it to achieve something humanity does not have.</p>
<p>In a world with ever more complexity, coordination and automation, Ethereum is inevitable.</p>
<p>You just need to understand the Ethereum endgame:</p>
<p>Trustless Trust</p>
