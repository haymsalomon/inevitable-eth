<h1 style="text-align:center;">Internet Native Settlement</h1>
<h2>The World Computer</h2>
<p>Ethereum is the <a href="/home/ethereum/world-computer">World Computer</a> - a <a href="/home/concepts/credible-neutrality">credibly neutral</a>, globally shared utility that exists between a network of thousands of untrusted computers (called <a href="/home/ethereum/network/node">nodes</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine a virtual computer that exists on the internet, where every user has equal access and status.</p>
<p>Crypto's innovation is the ability to operate the computer trustlessly and securely while guaranteeing open access.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Internet-Native Property Rights</h2>
<p><a href="/home/ethereum/evm/property-rights">Deep Dive: Internet-Native Property Rights</a></p>
<p>Ethereum achieves this by coordinating around the asset ETH; economic rewards and penalties incentivize actors to behave properly without explicit trust.</p>
<p>Consensus is predicated on the ability to distribute (and for PoS, the ability to confiscate) ETH. The asset ETH is the lifeblood of Ethereum; one cannot survive without the other.</p>
<p>The result: property rights are built into The World Computer from day 0.</p>
<p>Ethereum is a decentralized virtual computer that exists on the internet. It's fundamental properties include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>open, un-censorable access to anyone with an internet connection</li>
  <li>transparent, auditable record keeping</li>
  <li>exists in perpetuity</li>
</ul>
<p>and native property rights!</p>
<h2>Internet-Native Settlement</h2>
<p><a href="/home/concepts/settlement">Deep Dive: Settlement</a></p>
<p>With internet-native property rights, for the first time since its creation, we have internet-native settlement.</p>
<h3>Centralized Settlement</h3>
<p>First, let's discuss how settlement (the final step of the transfer of ownership, involving the exchange of assets and payments) works in the real world.</p>
<p>Most financial assets are held in trust at a handful of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depository_Trust_%26_Clearing_Corporation">centralized institutions</a>; "ownership" exists in the records of those institutions&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eg, you buy a stock from a broker. The broker simply processes the deal between you and the seller. In order to actually transfer ownership and settle the transaction, they send a message to the centralized institution and tell them to update the accounts you have there (more or less).</p>
<h3>Non-Financial Assets</h3>
<p>Non-financial assets aren't necessarily held centrally but still require a centralized actor to facilitate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's say you want to sell a camera. Even if you can set up a sale without a marketplace like eBay, you still (probably) need a payment processor like PayPal.</p>
<h3>The Decentralized Solution</h3>
<p>Ethereum supports 21st-century commerce with settlement built directly into the core systems; a new paradigm - decentralized settlement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Settling on Ethereum doesn't require permission or special access. It's available to all, for any reason, at any time.</p>
<h2>Liquidity</h2>
<p><a href="/home/concepts/liquidity">Deep Dive: Liquidity</a></p>
<p>Just like a car requires motor oil to function efficiently and safely, settlement requires liquidity.</p>
<p>Liquidity refers to the efficiency or ease with which an asset can be converted into the settlement asset (cash / $ETH) without affecting its market price.</p>
<p>Imagine a system with $1MM of liquidity:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trading ~$500, no problem.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Trading ~$250k, the system begins to degrade.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Trading $2MM, impossible.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The more liquidity available to a system, the more activity (number of trades, size of trade, etc) that system can support.</p>
<p>This presents a chicken-and-egg problem: does liquidity create trading activity or is liquidity just an effect of it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s leave that for the academics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reality is that liquidity is like gravity; the more it concentrates the stronger it attracts more liquidity.</p>
<h2>The Power Law</h2>
<p><a href="/home/concepts/power-law">Deep Dive: Power Law</a></p>
<p>In fact, liquidity’s behavior follows a power law: a relationship in which activity densely clusters around a relatively small amount of outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Liquidity will always pool in a few deep, concentrated pools.</p>
<p>Monies/currencies/assets that attract enough liquidity become critical to the functioning of modern global finance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider transactions done at the scale of nation states; sovereigns must ensure they trade in markets liquid enough to support their magnitude.</p>
<h2>Reserve Currency</h2>
<p><a href="/home/concepts/reserve-currency">Deep Dive: Reserve Currency</a></p>
<p>Once a currency/asset has reached a large enough scale, nations, central banks and other large institutions will begin stockpiling it to ensure orderly access to finance and to the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, we consider the currency/asset a Reserve Currency/Asset.</p>
<p>Today, there are just a handful of reserve currencies. The US dollar reigns supreme, with the Euro, the Japanese Yen and UK pound providing secondary capacity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Countries/banks/corporations build treasuries of these currencies for both offensive and defensive purposes.</p>
<p>Whether it’s Goldman Sachs or Aunt Tayna, all entities in the modern economy need access to goods and services that they can’t produce themselves.Holding dollars/euros/yen/pounds the insurance that they will be able to access the market when they need to.</p>
<h2>Implications of Centralization</h2>
<p>(Until crypto) systems that could support the scale of liquidity required for global commerce need:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>an issuing body (government)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>the full faith and credit of its equity holders (citizens)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>centralized control (the Fed)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>implicit force (military and justice system)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/home/background/history-finance">Using centralized systems, humanity has built the modern world</a>… for better or <a href="/home/background/gfc">worse</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 21st century, we are beginning to realize that centralization also leads to instability, corruption and zero-sum mentalities.</p>
<p>Bottom line, centralized systems always boil down to one question: which individuals are in control of the system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By its very nature, crypto rejects this idea.</p>
<h2>Inevitable Ethereum</h2>
<p>Look at the internet… for all the fancy bells and whistles we have today, it’s still an infant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before crypto, the internet was just a way to post and distribute information. Commerce was possible, but was routed through non-internet systems.</p>
<p>Post crypto, we have another option. One that isn’t controlled by a single entity, that can’t exclude or prejudice any party on earth.</p>
<p>Politics, revenge, back-room deals will always matter… but on Ethereum they will NEVER result in censorship, exclusion, or confiscation</p>
<p>Liquidity is like gravity: it’s going to hold itself together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It takes an extremely compelling reason for an entity, let alone a system, to make a change.</p>
<p>Ethereum’s pitch:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“We can offer something never before seen in centralized systems.</p>
  <p>We can offer fairness.”</p>
</blockquote>
