<h1 style="text-align:center;">OFAC Censorship</h1>
<h2>The World Computer</h2>
<p>Ethereum is a distributed computing platform. A network of 1,000s of computers (<a href="/home/ethereum/network/node">nodes</a>) coordinating using <a href="/home/ethereum/network/consensus/pos">Proof of Stake</a> (PoS) to keep the <a href="/home/ethereum/evm">Ethereum Virtual Machine</a> (EVM) in sync.</p>
<p>The EVM is the shared computing platform, the <a href="/home/ethereum/blockchain">blockchain</a> its history and ETH its lifeblood.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ethereum is still very young. It is slow, expensive and still evolving.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But even though we are early, the Ethereum endgame has already come into focus:</p>
<p><a href="/home/ethereum/world-computer/endgame/trustless-trust">ETH will be the pristine currency of trustless trust</a>.</p>
<p>Trustless trust is predicated on a decentralized Ethereum. The more nodes that are controlled by a single entity, the easier it becomes to attack the network.</p>
<p>Trustless trust comes from credible neutrality.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Credible Neutrality</h2>
<p><a href="/home/concepts/credible-neutrality">Deep Dive: Credible Neutrality</a></p>
<p>Credible neutrality comes from decentralization.</p>
<p>Every Ethereum user is willing to use the system because they know they will get the same treatment as any other user, whether that user is <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin">Vitalik Buterin</a> or Uncle Andrey.</p>
<p>No government, company or foe can bend the rules to cause you trouble.</p>
<p>On the first order, the EVM provides credible neutrality simply by being a perfectly neutral system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just like the laws of physics are built into our world, unbreakable <a href="/home/ethereum/world-computer/internet-settlement">property rights are built into Ethereum</a>.</p>
<p>Put simply, it's impossible to execute an unfair transaction.</p>
<p>Let's say a bank (XTF), run by a drugged up criminal (FBS) is in severe distress and needs a bailout.</p>
<p>IRL, FBS can just call the Federal Reserve and have them turn on the cash printers.</p>
<p>On-chain, there's no one to call. FBS has to take his Ls just like the rest of us.</p>
<p>This is not a new idea, this is the foundation of Ethereum, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general.</p>
<p>All users are treated equal. Anyone can interact with the blockchain for any time, for any reason.</p>
<p>...Enter the United States Government.</p>
<h2>Tornado Cash Sanctions</h2>
<p>In August 2022, the US Treasury <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916">hurled a Molotov Cocktail into the crypto community</a> and declared that a piece of code (and all that wrote, used and support it) was a terrorist.</p>
<p>And, as all non-Westerners are very aware, <a href="/home/background/sanctions">America does everything she can to destroy "terrorists."</a></p>
<p>&lt;NOTE&gt;</p>
<p>Two things.</p>
<p>1) As a result of the sanctions, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/alexey-pertsev-most-influential-2022/">Alex Pertsev was arrested and has been in custody since August 2022</a>. Meanwhile, SBF ruined crypto and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sbf-is-sleeping-better-playing-video-games-new-york-times-sam-bankman-fried-interview-dunked-on-for-going-soft-on-ftx-co-founder/">he's playing video games in his penthouse</a>.</p>
<p>2) <a href="https://twitter.com/songadaymann/status/1559983727488409601">Best related content from this episode is by @songadaymann</a></p>
<p>&lt;/ NOTE&gt;</p>
<p>These sanctions are ridiculous for a ton of reasons, you can find a better explanation from back in August.</p>
<p>Let's just focus on the results: anyone who has ever touched (or been touched by) TornadoCash is now on the USA <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/office-of-foreign-assets-control-sanctions-programs-and-information">Office of Foreign Assets Control</a> (OFAC) shitlist.</p>
<p>There are a ton of specifics around the OFAC shitlist, but the summary is that no one can do any financial transactions with anyone on that list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those that break this rule are also added to the list.</p>
<p>As the USA controls the global financial system, this is a HUGE deal.</p>
<h2>Implications of Sanctioning a Protocol</h2>
<p>Tornado Cash is not a small protocol. 1000s of people of use it for all sorts of reasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, many reasons were/are shady, but many others were perfectly legit (<a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/buterin-armstrong-aoki-targeted-in-tornado-cash-eth-dusting-spree/">and not all were consensual</a>).</p>
<p>The first question on everyone's mind: were the users on the shitlist too?</p>
<p>Let's say Alice heard about Tornado Cash back in August 2021 and wanted to try out the tech with .1 ETH. She never used it again.</p>
<p>Now, in August 2022, Tornado Cash is a terrorist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So does that make Alice a terrorist to?</p>
<p>These kinds of questions always have two answers: the "correct" answer, as it exists in the minds of US officials, and the market's answer.</p>
<p>The market doesn't reallllllyyyyy think things through, it just acts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so it decided that Alice is, in fact, a terrorist.</p>
<p>Remember, the way the OFAC shitlist works is that anyone who transacts with someone on the list also gets on the list.</p>
<p>So, when the market decides that Alice is a terrorist, it is also deciding that people who want to stay off the shitlist cannot transact with Alice.</p>
<h2>Realities of Sanctioning a Protocol</h2>
<p>So what does this mean for Ethereum, a platform that is predicated on equal access for all... even if a person shows up on the OFAC shitlist?</p>
<p>The EVM is a credibly neutral space, maintained by 1,000s nodes.</p>
<p>The EVM wont care about OFAC, but the node operators sure do.</p>
<p>This is the context for the <a href="https://mevwatch.info">screenshots</a> you've been seeing. Those incredibly scary graphics that make it look Ethereum has been forever compromised by the US Government.</p>

<p>No one wants to accept a transaction from a wallet that touched Tornado Cash.</p>
<p>Look - I get it. If &gt;75% of transactions are being censored off of one stupid sanction, is Ethereum doomed?</p>
<p>I don't know the objective truth, I can only give you my personal perspective...</p>
<p>...but I emphatically believe that this just isn't that big of a deal.</p>
<h2>Reasons to Believe</h2>
<p>At this point it's time to draw this thread to a conclusion; we'll need to talk through what all of this really means in future threads.</p>
<p>But let's walk very quickly through some of the reasons to think this will all work out.</p>
<ul>
  <li>First, it's important to think about what that red-square-chart-of-death is actually showing. It's saying "x% of blocks came from block builders/relays that say they will comply with the OFAC shitlist," not "of all the transactions that are pending, x% were censored."</li>
  <li>Second, think about how transactions work; <a href="/home/ethereum/network/consensus/eip-1559">specifically the market dynamics behind the priority fee/tip</a>. Let's say Alice REALLY needs to push a transaction through ASAP. All she needs to do is increase the fee until a it creates a block more lucrative than one that's "censored."</li>
  <li>Third, let's say Alice wont increase her fee, but she can wait. If 75% of blocks are censored, she can only get her txn in in one in every 4 blocks. So, instead of waiting for 12 secs, she must wait 48. Censorship increases to 99%? She just needs to wait ~20 mins.</li>
  <li>Finally, there are mitigations that can be built directly into the protocol. The most promising solution (IMO) is implementing the <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@fradamt/H1ZqdtrBF">Forward Inclusion List (aka crList)</a>. Tl;dr the proposer can tack on txns after the selecting a prebuilt block.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, while US Treasury did its best to ruin Ethereum with the Tornado Cash sanctions, it will be unsuccessful.</p>
<p>First, because of the market dynamics of a decentralized network.</p>
<p>Second, because the community will outbuild them.</p>
<p>Ethereum is inevitable.</p>
