<h1 style="text-align:center;">Decentralization</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>Decentralization is a big word that refers to a lot of things, and there are a countless number of DAOs out there, all doing something unique. These are just my thoughts from my one limited, biased corner of the internet.</i></p>
<h2>The Decentralization Buzzword</h2>
<p>Buzzword: a word or phrase, often an item of jargon, that is fashionable at a particular time or in a particular context.</p>
<p>Let's begin with a question: do you think "decentralization" is a buzzword?</p>
<p>If I am answering that question, my first thought is "well that depends on what you mean by decentralization.</p>
<p>Or, more specifically, that depends on the context we are talking about."</p>
<p>Ethereum decentralization? Absolutely not a buzzword.</p>
<p>Otherwise? Well...</p>
<h2>The World Computer</h2>
<p>Ethereum is the <a href="/home/ethereum/world-computer">World Computer</a>; the purpose of Ethereum is to be a global, <a href="/home/concepts/credible-neutrality">credibly neutral</a> <a href="/home/concepts/settlement">settlement</a> platform.</p>
<p>Credibly neutrality is THE distinguishing feature of Ethereum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without it, Ethereum is just an objectively worse AWS.</p>
<p>Credibly neutrality is the principle that everyone is treated equally, regardless of their status.</p>
<p>It is not enough for a mechanism to be fairly designed, it’s also vital that it can convince a large and diverse group of people that it is fair.</p>
<p><a href="https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/">As Vitalik Buterin puts it</a>:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A mechanism is credibly neutral if just by looking at the mechanism’s design, it is easy to see that the mechanism does not discriminate for or against any specific people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On first glance, this is achieved by <a href="/home/ethereum/network/consensus/pos">Proof of Stake</a> (PoS).</p>
<p>PoS (and all <a href="/home/concepts/crypto-economics">crypto-economic</a> <a href="/home/ethereum/network/consensus">consensus mechanisms</a>) is a set of well defined systems and procedures that dictate how those operating Ethereum (specifically the <a href="/home/ethereum/evm">Ethereum Virtual Machine</a> - EVM) coordinate.</p>
<p>PoS is the mechanism we can look at and agree is credibly neutral.</p>
<h2>Human Nature</h2>
<p>But here's the things about rules: they are written to be broken.</p>
<p>I am not trying to make a moral judgement, rather I'm speaking to human nature. If we encounter a system of power, [a subset of us] will do everything in their power to capture that system.</p>
<p>If we want to achieve true credibly neutrality, we need to build systems that account for this fact of the human condition.</p>
<p>We must design a system that doesn't allow power to coalesce in a way that can be seized and used to capture the system.</p>
<p>The question is how?</p>
<p>Let's just skip through the pontificating; the reality is that this kind of system is a logical paradox.</p>
<p>Financial/computing systems are artificial creations. Any rule that exists was conjured out of thin air, and only survives by the good graces of those in charge.</p>
<h2>A Decentralized Solution</h2>
<p>In 2008, we finally found a solution. Led by Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is the answer to the question: "how can we design a payment app that splits power equally to all participants."</p>
<p>In 2015, Ethereum extended that solution to apply to <a href="/home/ethereum/evm/state-machine">general-purpose computing</a>.</p>
<p>The gift of Satoshi was to show us that decentralization is the solution to the credible neutrality paradox.</p>
<p>First, we create a system of radical equality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, we get as many diverse, uncoordinated and untrusted parties as possible to participate.</p>
<p>We haven't changed human nature - there are still people that want to control Ethereum and are actively thinking about ways to capture the World Computer.</p>
<p>But we can fight back! All we need to do is get more and more good people to participate.</p>
<p>If you think about it, we don't even need them to be good people.</p>
<p>Imagine if there were only 10 (similarly sized) stakers, each one a bad-faith actor looking to capture Ethereum.</p>
<p>Even if 100% of participants are malicious, PoS will keep Ethereum credibly neutral.</p>
<h3>The Internet Metaphor</h3>
<p>Think about the internet - under all the jargon the internet is simply a network of computers that share data from peer-to-peer... just like Ethereum.</p>
<p>Now imagine "capturing" the internet. Let's say you wanted to control kinds of information and people could use it.</p>
<p>Maybe you can find some countries that agree with you; get ideological enough and you could probably get the FrEeDoM-LovInG-WeSt on board.</p>
<p>But short of physically controlling every single person (not even server. person), any restrictions will be comically outstripped.</p>
<h2>The Value of Decentralization</h2>
<p>Ethereum is credibly neutral as long as PoS remains fair, and PoS will always remain fair as long as Ethereum is decentralized.</p>
<p>This insight is the core value proposition of Ethereum; it is the foundation of ETH's value.</p>
<p>From decentralization comes credible neutrality. <a href="/home/background">From credible neutrality comes world domination</a>.</p>
<p>So, let's look at the big picture.</p>
<p>The purpose of Bitcoin is to create a credibly neutral payment platform. The purpose of Ethereum is to create a credibly neutral computing platform.</p>
<p>In both cases, credible neutrality comes directly from decentralization.</p>
<p>And let's be explicit here. Decentralization means that the individual computers that operate Ethereum are in different physical locations and operated by different people.</p>
<p>And within the context of PoS, decentralization refers to the diversity of people staking ETH.</p>
<p>Ethereum is valuable because it is decentralized. Does that mean we should try to add decentralization to everything?</p>
<p>Which brings us back to the question we began with: is "decentralization" a buzz word?</p>
<p>My answer: for Ethereum, NO. Decentralization is critical.</p>
<p>But outside of Ethereum? Decentralization is definitely a buzzword.</p>
<p>A pretty freaking meaningless one.</p>
<h2>Decentralization Theater</h2>
<p>I could start naming names, but we all do it. Everyone just adds "decentralized" to their project because... that's part of what crypto means?</p>
<p>Now don't get me wrong, there are places where decentralization matters.</p>
<p>For example, I think we should care if <a href="https://rocketpool.net/">Rocket Pool</a> is decentralized.</p>
<p>I think that are interesting ideas around decentralized banks (like <a href="https://frax.finance/">Frax Finance</a> or <a href="https://www.olympusdao.finance/">Olympus DAO</a>... although jury's out).</p>
<p>But for the most part, <a href="/home/ethereum/world-computer/governance">I think that decentralization is a parlor trick DAOs use for 1) regulator cover and 2) community shaping/hype</a>.</p>
<p>I recognize that I have a particularly cynical take, but let's just be realistic about "decentralized" DAOs.</p>
<p>I think of (non-Ethereum based discussions of) decentralization the same way <a href="/home/ethereum/world-computer/regulation">I think of validator-level censorship resistance</a>: a lot of unnuanced, often uneducated, debates about a problem that has been blown way of context.</p>
<h2>The Ethereum Endgame</h2>
<p>In the depths of 2022, these were the thoughts that shaped my understanding of crypto.</p>
<p>Ethereum decentralization is real. We need to protect it, as it underpins the value of ETH and the premise of the entire system.</p>
<p>The EVM provides a credibly neutral platform.</p>
<p>ANYONE can build ANYTHING within the EVM, that's the magic of Ethereum.</p>
<p>Until December 2022, I thought this was the entire story. We've built the untrusted system so that everyone can go build whatever (trusted) system they wanted!</p>
<p>And then, I met <a href="https://twitter.com/sreeramkannan">Sreeram Kannan</a>.</p>
<p>Sreeram Kannan is the man behind <a href="/home/ethereum/upgrades/middleware/eigenlayer/services">EigenLayer, the first (but not the last) re-staking collective</a>.</p>
<p>Re-staking is the concept that made this all click for me. Once I understand how it works, the Ethereum endgame clicked into place.</p>
<p>In the Ethereum endgame, <a href="/home/ethereum/world-computer/endgame/trustless-trust">ETH is the global currency of trustless trust</a>.</p>
<p>Using ETH, any activity, interaction, data point that requires trust can be transformed into a trustless fact.</p>
<p>All based on a decentralized World Computer.</p>
<p>In the 21st century, centralization is critically and completely failing us.</p>
<p>ETH is how we can coordinate without centralization.</p>
<p>The internet of things, a globalizing economy, a post nation-state world…</p>
<p>Ethereum is inevitable.</p>
