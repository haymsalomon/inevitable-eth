<h1 style="text-align:center;">De-Fi is a Better Way</h1>
<h2>A Credibly Neutral Network</h2>
<p>Ethereum is a network of 1,000s of computers (<a href="https://inevitableeth.com/home/ethereum/network/node">nodes</a>) coordinating using <a href="https://inevitableeth.com/home/ethereum/network/consensus/pos">Proof of Stake</a> (PoS) to keep the <a href="https://inevitableeth.com/home/ethereum/evm">Ethereum Virtual Machine</a> (EVM) in sync.</p>
<p>The EVM is the shared computing platform, the blockchain its history and ETH its lifeblood.</p>
<p>This "network of nodes" is the foundation upon which Ethereum ultimately derives its value. The more decentralized, the more value.</p>
<p>From decentralization comes <a href="https://inevitableeth.com/home/concepts/credible-neutrality">credible neutrality</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without credible neutrality, we might as well be using FB-dollaroos in Farmville-DeFi.</p>
<h2>From Bitcoin to Ethereum</h2>
<p>First, Satoshi gave us Bitcoin the first decentralized application.</p>
<p>Then Vitalik Buterin gave us Ethereum, which uses the decentralization technology to build a computer.</p>
<p><a href="/home/ethereum/world-computer">The World Computer</a>.</p>
<p>Where Bitcoin lets users add and subtract, Ethereum lets users do anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solidity is <a href="/home/concepts/turing-complete">Turing-complete</a> (That's nerd for "able to do anything that any other programming language can do." Including the one that's running your Macbook).</p>
<p>Ethereum is the computer that is native to the internet. It provides the basic structure for a whole new set of applications to run.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentralized Finance (De-Fi) is the first category of these applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NFTs [are/might be] the second.</p>
<h2>The Draws of De-Fi</h2>
<p>When I ask most people why they believe in De-Fi, I get a lot of idealistic and utopian answers:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Decentralization</li>
  <li>Transparency</li>
  <li>Censorship Resistance</li>
  <li>More equitable access</li>
  <li>Alternative to political economies</li>
  <li>More pure democracy</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm just going to be real with you, I don't believe in a lot of those things.</p>
<p>Let's set aside all the decentralization theater and the scams and just look at the working environment we created.</p>
<p>The reason I am a true believer is because I've seen how Trad-Fi works, and I can say with absolute certainty:</p>
<p>De-Fi is simply just better.</p>
<h2>Lessons from Trad-Fi&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Let me share a story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background, I used to work for the worlds top 3 CPG companies. At this point I worked for the Treasury VP.</p>
<p>I was in charge of direct cash flow, which can be roughly described as managing the <a href="/home/concepts/liquidity">liquidity</a> of my company.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="/home/concepts/working-capital">Here's a deeper dive into cash flow for those so inclined</a>.</p>
<p>The critical function was simple: minimize the operational cash while ensuring all bills are paid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run your cash balance too high? You cannot invest in future growth or pay dividends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Too low? Miss a payment and risk disrupting the entire business.</p>
<p>Long story short, one week we began missing forecasts significantly. As a result, regular business expenses began drawing on our emergency buffer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6-week deep dive later, we realized all our models were built on raw inputs that were just "best guesses" by our back office.</p>
<p>Now put that in contrast to how things work in De-Fi. Every interaction creates a neatly organized paper trail.</p>
<p>While UST is crashing to $0, <a href="https://twitter.com/samkazemian">Sam Kazemian</a> can legitimately say "it is mathematically impossible for $FRAX to depeg."</p>

<h2>A Manual Past</h2>
<p>The more you learn about the way Trad-Fi actually works, the more you realize how inefficient and manual it is.</p>
<p>Think using <a href="https://etherscan.io/">Etherscan</a> is a pain? Good luck pulling my old company's financials from a ~2005 version of SAP.</p>
<p>Sometimes I had to pull data from magnetic tape.</p>
<p>One time, I had to send ~$1.5B to the IRS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CFO put his chair behind me and said "I'm sitting here until it's over."</p>
<p>I sat there "working" for 5 hours until we finally got a notification it settled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We kept asking our banker why it was taking so long, he said "ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è."</p>
<p>Contrast back with De-Fi: our control over our collateral is so precise that we can automatically move it around based on market conditions.</p>
<p>Take a look at what options look like on The World Computer: <a href="/home/ethereum/world-computer/projects/dopex">Dopex Atlantic Options</a>.</p>
<h2>A Brighter Future</h2>
<p>Ethereum is the computer that is native to the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the native computer can come <a href="/home/ethereum/evm/property-rights">native property rights</a>.</p>
<p>De-Fi and NFTs are the first ideas built on this fundamental concept, but they wont be the last... <a href="/home/background/mass-comm">Do you realize how young the internet is</a>???</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons to believe in Ethereum, some optimistic...</p>
<ul>
  <li>a world moving increasingly online</li>
</ul>
<p>...and some more practical...</p>
<ul>
  <li>the recognition of <a href="/home/background">The West's arbitrary control of the global economic system, and also its (perceived) abuse of that power</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>De-Fi is a Better Way</h2>
<p>For me, the biggest reason to believe comes from personal experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look, I get it... I've been on-chain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing works. All of this is confusing. UX sucks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But holy crap is it so much better than Trad-Fi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let alone what it's capable of!&nbsp;</p>
<p>And we're still so early.</p>
<p>I would consider myself a De-Fi zealot; I believe so much in the vision that I feel a moral duty to help it come to life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Want to know why?&nbsp;</p>
<p>De-Fi is simply a better way.</p>
