<p>Let's pretend you are a shop owner and I a potential customer who just walked in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I walk around your store and start to fill my basket. You aren't particularly interested until you see me grab a high-value item. And then another, this time not only high value, but super high margin. By the time I approach your counter, I've become much more than a potential customer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a jackpot.</p>
<p>You scan all my items, trying to keep a neutral face. Finally, the unsaid total is staring us both loudly in the face, and you turn to me and ask “how will you be paying?”</p>
<p>I reach in to my back pocket and pull out a notebook.</p>
<h2>Would You Accept Dollirs?</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="/magic-money-notebook.png"></figure>
<p>The above representation doesn't do it justice; it's actually pretty impressive. Extremely professional, filled with high quality artwork and logos. Even some thoughtful words about the nature of humanity and the future. And there are some very impressive endorsements, most from people who've been so successful they've turned it into celebrity.</p>
<p>“I don't actually have any cash on me, but do you accept Dollirs?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>I leave it there, obviously expecting recognition.</p>
<p>When you indicate that you don't know what I'm talking about, I sigh - somewhere between annoyance and pity. I begin explaining “Dollirs are the future of money. They are exactly the same as real, American US Dollars, but they are entirely digital.</p>
<p>1 Dollir = $1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Forever and always."</p>
<p>I then go on to explain some nonsense that doesn't seem to make sense but essentially it boils down to a ledger system. Inside the notebook is a list of everyone who is participating in the Dollir system and their current balance. In order to use Dollirs, you simply change the balances in the book using some sort of system that verifies that the person changing is the sender.</p>
<p>I flip through about a dozen pages and then show you the notebook, pointing at a line.</p>
<p>“Right here, this is me - Haym. As you can see I have 1,051 Dollirs, which is just enough to cover my purchase.”</p>
<p>So… do you accept Dollirs?</p>
<h2>Evaluating Money</h2>
<p>Every bone in your body is screaming “NO FREAKING WAY.”</p>
<p>But your eyes noticed Tom Brady and Shaquille O'Neal on the cover… and your ears heard me talk about the double digit interest you could get if you held Dollirs… and didn't your brain remember that they were naming a stadium and a F1 team after Dollirs?</p>
<p>Before you decide to listen to the soft, squishy parts of your body, you come to a moment of clarity.</p>
<p>You need to do your own research!</p>
<p>So, let's discuss all the things you should think about before trading away your wares for Dollirs.</p>
<h3>Kicking the Tires</h3>
<p>The first thing you need to think about: what actually are Dollirs?</p>
<p>When I gave you the explanation, I made is super clear that one of the most incredible parts about Dollirs are that ANYONE, including you, can independently verify the entire system.</p>
<p>But verification is a much taller task than it sounds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's one small example: remember that Dollirs are able to verify that the sender is authorizes the transaction? Well that one system in an almost unimaginably complex system, built out of concepts from computer science and math that have only existed for the last ~50 years. Yes, you can try to understand it at a high level, and then try to verify the underlying concepts by actually reading the research papers…</p>
<p>But are you going to put in that work?</p>
<p>Look, the reality is that you (probably) didn't ever bother to learn how cash or credit cards work… you simply accepted it because everyone else did*.</p>
<p><span class="text-tiny"><i>*The real reason you accept cash or credit is because both are financially equivalent to USD (or whatever your local currency is). The reason USD is is accepted is not just because of the social context, but specifically because that is the currency by which the government requires taxes to be paid.&nbsp;</i></span></p>
<h3>Social Proof</h3>
<p>The first thing you look for are people who understand the technology and see what they say about it. For the most part, they are saying extremely positive, encouraging things about the notebook-money industry.</p>
<p>Then, you check out all of the names on front of my notebook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And let's be real, it's impressive.</p>
<p>Advisors, endorsements, recommendations, you name it. And not only from super-nerds or bimbo-celebrities, it's hard to tell what brings things group together, except for the fact that you recognize so many of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
