<p>Let's pretend you are a shop owner and I a potential customer who just walked in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I walk around your store and start to fill my basket. You aren't particularly interested until you see me grab a high-value item. And then another, this time not only high value, but super high margin. By the time I approach your counter, I've become much more than a potential customer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a jackpot.</p>
<p>You scan all my items, trying to keep a neutral face. Finally, the unsaid total is staring us both loudly in the face, and you turn to me and ask “how will you be paying?”</p>
<p>I reach in to my back pocket and pull out a notebook.</p>
<h2>Would You Accept Dollirs?</h2>

<p>The above representation doesn't do it justice; it's actually pretty impressive. Extremely professional, filled with high quality artwork and logos. Even some thoughtful words about the nature of humanity and the future. And there are some very impressive endorsements, most from people who've been so successful they've turned it into celebrity.</p>
<p>“I don't actually have any cash on me, but do you accept Dollirs?” I leave it there, obviously expecting recognition.</p>
<p>When you indicate that you don't know what I'm talking about, I sigh - somewhere between annoyance and pity. I begin explaining “Dollirs are the future of money. They are exactly the same as real, American US Dollars, but they are entirely digital.</p>
<p>1 Dollir = $1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Forever and always."</p>
<p>I then go on to explain some nonsense that doesn't seem to make sense but essentially it boils down to a ledger system. Inside the notebook is a list of everyone who is participating in the Dollir system and their current balance. In order to use Dollirs, you simply change the balances in the book using some sort of system that verifies that the person changing is the sender.</p>
<p>I flip through about a dozen pages and then show you the notebook, pointing at a line.</p>
<p>“Right here, this is me - Haym. As you can see I have 1,051 Dollirs, which is just enough to cover my purchase.”</p>
<p>So… do you accept Dollirs?</p>
