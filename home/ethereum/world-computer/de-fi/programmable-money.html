<h1 style="text-align:center;">Programmable Money</h1>
<h2>Money Throughout History</h2>
<p>Money is a concept older than history; by 2008 it had permeated our lives so deeply that it’s hard to understand the world without reference to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over all that time, money has basically flipped between being backed by shiny metal or government threats.</p>
<p>In 2008, <a href="/home/background/gfc">as the modern financial system collapsed</a>, Satoshi Nakamoto published the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin whitepaper</a>.</p>
<p>A couple years later, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-creator-of-ethereum-got-into-crypto-because-blizzard-nerfed-his-character/">Blizzard nerfed siphon life</a> and so Vitalik Buterin created Ethereum in retribution.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is the promise, Ethereum is the delivery.</p>
<h2>The World Computer</h2>
<p>The goal of blockchain technology is to create a computing environment using a decentralized, trustless network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <a href="/home/concepts/credible-neutrality">credibly neutral</a> network.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is a simple machine that has accounts and balances, and can process transactions that send value between them.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="/home/ethereum/evm/state-machine">Ethereum is a general purpose computer</a>.</p>
<p>That’s how you should understand Ethereum: the <a href="/home/ethereum/world-computer">World Computer</a>. A shared utility, running across a global network of untrusted <a href="/home/ethereum/network/node">nodes</a>, economically secured by ETH.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<ul>
  <li>anyone can build on it, and anyone can build on top of anyone else’s work</li>
  <li>it provides <a href="/home/ethereum/world-computer/internet-settlement">internet-native money</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Building on The World Computer requires a focus on Composability.</p>
<h2>Composability</h2>
<p>A highly composable system provides components that can be selected and assembled in various combinations to satisfy specific requirements (both current and future).</p>
<p>For example, take tokens: conceptually, a token is just an app running on The World Computer.</p>
<p>Imagine 1,000s of coders creating bespoke apps that they call tokens. Exchanges would have to carefully integrate each one, one at a time.</p>
<p>Forget De-Fi entirely.</p>
<p>Instead, <a href="/home/ethereum/blockchain/token-standards">token standards</a> provide the template upon which developers can build. These templates provide the properties and characteristics that one must have in order to be considered a token.</p>
<p>All a dev needs to do is fill in these functions and hit deploy.</p>
<p>By conforming to a token standard, a token can immediately access a ton of De-Fi protocols (also World Computer apps):</p>
<ul>
  <li>LP/swap on <a href="https://uniswap.org/">Uniswap</a></li>
  <li>Lend on <a href="https://www.euler.finance/">Euler Finance</a></li>
  <li>Trade on <a href="https://looksrare.org/">LooksRare</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All without any custom integrations; the apps already know how to communicate.</p>
<h2>Programmable Money</h2>
<p>But this isn’t just about easy development and access to marketplaces. This is about creating programmable property, assets and money.</p>
<p>Lending protocols and AMMs came first because they have direct corollaries in the real world.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is what came next…</p>
<h3>Ve-Token System</h3>
<figure class="image"><img src="/ve-tokens-1.jpeg"></figure>
<p><a href="/home/ethereum/world-computer/de-fi/programmable-money/ve-tokens">Deep Dive: ve-Tokens</a></p>
<p>The ve-token system is the first example of a technology that was inconceivable before The World Computer.</p>
<p>Built upon the technologies provided by many different protocols, the system leverages these money Legos to build a system that no single builder could have made.</p>
<p>Core to understanding the ve-token revolution is understanding “bribing” (aka voting incentives).</p>
<p>This process is how De-Fi expresses the economic value of the voting power of a ve-token, and provides credibly neutral monetization channels.</p>
<p>Look at Trad-Fi; tokens are ROUGHLY analogous to stocks. Today, most stockholders ignore their voting power or delegate to a proxy.</p>
<p>Imagine a world where a stockholder could monetize that power.</p>
<p>The stock market is centuries old, De-Fi is 2... but De-Fi did it first.</p>
<h3>Stablecoins</h3>
<p><a href="/home/ethereum/world-computer/de-fi/stablecoins">Deep Dive: Stablecoins</a></p>
<p>Not sold? Let's talk about stablecoins.</p>
<p>First, we borrowed from the real world; stablecoins mirrored the value of real-world cash.</p>
<p>Today, stablecoins are evolving into a new principle: as a protocol's TVL rises, it has a should try to return liquidity back into De-Fi.</p>
<h3>Protocols</h3>
<p>Sophisticated programmable money has permeated through much of De-Fi. Here are just a few examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/home/ethereum/world-computer/projects/dopex">Dopex has created composable, programmable options</a>. These options can be paired with an endless combination of products to create novel financial products (Atlantic Options)</li>
  <li><a href="/home/ethereum/world-computer/projects/olympus">Olympus DAO has developed a robust theory and application of De-Fi bonds</a> to shape monetary policy</li>
  <li><a href="/home/ethereum/world-computer/projects/synthetix">Synthetix has developed a new economic primitive</a> that can be broken down and remade into a synthetic version of almost any asset.</li>
</ul>
<p>These protocols and so many more are developing products that combine different money legos to create something brand new.</p>
<h2>De-Fi is a Better Way</h2>
<p>Back in Corporate-Fi, I used to manage $10+B/year in cash flow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even at the highest levels, nothing works... almost everything is smoke and mirrors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I believe there is a better way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First we need transparency and credible neutrality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then we need innovation.</p>
<p>This is just the beginning. De-Fi is so young, programmable money is practically an infant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's impossible for a single person to project out.</p>
<p>But that's the thing about Ethereum: no single person has to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every person can contribute.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today and in the future.</p>
<p>Forever.</p>
