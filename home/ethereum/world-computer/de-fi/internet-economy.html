<h1 style="text-align:center;">The Internet Economy</h1>
<h2>Does Crypto Eat the World</h2>
<p>Think about Ethereum as the <a href="/home/ethereum/world-computer">World Computer</a> and the promise of <a href="/home/ethereum/world-computer/de-fi/programmable-money">programmable money</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the unspoken question: “so what does this look like in 50+ years? Does crypto eat the world?”</p>
<p>Real talk? I don’t think so.</p>
<h2>Two Economies</h2>
<p>The modern system is built out of two economies: the real economy and the financial economy.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Real economy - production, transportation and consumption of goods and services.</li>
  <li>Financial economy - allocation and deployment of resources across space and time.</li>
</ul>
<p>The real economy concerns things that individual humans need to survive and/or live a high quality life.</p>
<p>The financial economy is responsible for ensuring the all the necessary resources are in the right place at the right time to make the real economy possible.</p>
<h2>The Power of Finance</h2>
<p>Buying a burger? No problem, no financial economy needed.</p>
<p>Buying a house? Most people don’t have enough cash… but most people will earn enough over their life to afford a house.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A loan is a tool that allows you to pull forward your future earnings and spend it today.</p>
<p>At its best, the financial economy is magic. It allows people and businesses to manipulate value across time and space.</p>
<ul>
  <li>When capital is needed, finance can manifest it before your eyes.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>When it’s not, finance can whisk it away and use it for something else productive.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Too Much of a Good Thing</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, things are not at their best. Over time, the financial economy has grown from a supporting role to the main act.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/the-rise-and-rise-of-the-global-balance-sheet-how-productively-are-we-using-our-wealth">According to McKinsey</a>, the two are roughly equal in size.</p>

<p>The problem? As McKinsey put it “At the global level, real assets constitute net worth, while aggregate financial assets and liabilities net to zero.”</p>
<p>Put another way, the more capital that gets tied up in the financial economy, the less is available for the real economy.</p>
<h2>Huge Problems</h2>
<p>Along with climate change, the growing disconnect between the financial and the real economy is the crisis of our generation.</p>
<p>But this isn’t a story of our parents our grandparents. This is the story of the millennia; you can trace it back to ~1490.</p>
<p><a href="/home/background/history-finance">The rise of The West is the story of the development of modern finance</a>.</p>
<p>The invention of the printing press by Gutenberg, the concentration of wealth by Fugger, the intensely expensive wars of The Catholic Monarchs.</p>
<p>This was the crucible that gave us finance.</p>
<h2>The Internet</h2>
<p>For 500 years, mankind have been developing off of those fundamental principles.</p>
<p>And then about 30 year ago, we had our Gutenberg moment. In October 1994, Jim Clark and Marc Andreessen released Netscape.</p>
<p>The world has never been the same since.</p>
<p>I’m not going to try to describe the impact of the internet, partially because we’re all living it but mostly because we have barely seen anything yet.</p>
<p><a href="/home/background/mass-comm/printing-press">The printing press threw Europe into chaos for centuries and reshaped the planet</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/home/background/dot-com">The internet is 30 years old</a>.</p>
<p>16 years ago, I was lazy in World of Warcraft and I asked my parents if I could “buy gold.” They thought I was being groomed.</p>
<p>10 years ago I went on a tour of Riot Games. My dad turned to me and said “can you believe this? All from selling NOTHING”</p>
<p>We are so early.</p>
<h2>Three Economies</h2>
<p>The modern system is built out of two economies: the real economy and the financial economy.</p>
<p>The future system will be built out of three economies: the real economy, the financial economy and the internet economy.</p>
<p>Ethereum is the <a href="/home/concepts/credible-neutrality">credibly neutral</a> computer that runs the internet economy.</p>
<p>Just like the real/financial economies today, the real/financial/internet economies will be distinct entities that are seamlessly integrated.</p>
<p>You might deposit your savings at a bank, they might issues loans on <a href="https://aave.com/">Aave</a>, someone might take an Aave loan to buy a house.</p>
<p>History is funny sometimes, the same time it destroys the old way it provides the path forward.</p>
<p>The printing press split Christianity, remade Europe, gave us the scientific method and so much more.</p>
<p>The printing press didn’t cause any of this, but it did catalyze all of it.</p>
<p>Take a look at the world around you. Things are falling apart. But history is funny sometimes.</p>
