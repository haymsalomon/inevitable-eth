<h2>A New Ghost Appears</h2>
<p><a href="https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-gho/8730">Back in July, Aave announced GHO</a>, a new collateral-backed stablecoin.</p>
<p>Deposit collateral, mint GHO. Burn GHO, reclaim collateral.</p>
<p>Essentially the spooky-themed equivalent of DAI.</p>
<p>Think about how Aave works today. It generates revenue via loaning out user deposits, and it incentivizes deposits by passing through most of that interest.</p>
<p>With GHO, Aave is the supplier of capital. 100% of interest payments can go directly back to the DAO.</p>
<p>Aave is taking a page from <a href="https://frax.finance/">Frax Finance</a> and deploying an <a href="https://docs.frax.finance/amo/overview">AMO</a>-type system.</p>
<p>"Facilitators" are whitelisted entities that can trustlessly mint and burn GHO. Thus, Aave can both stabilize GHO and farm yield automatically.</p>

<h2>What is a Stablecoin?</h2>

<p>So GHO is sounds like a pretty good idea for Aave, but what does it mean in context?</p>
<p>Is life just an endless series of letters pegged to $1?</p>
<p>Let's take a step back and think about stablecoins holistically.</p>
<p>Stablecoins are massively important:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://defillama.com/stablecoins">They are already &gt;$150 B</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/samkazemian">Sam Kazemian</a> calls them "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xe--fFyjXM">crypto's 3rd trillion dollar opportunity</a>"</li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/stablekwon">Do Kwon's</a> <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/the-fall-of-terra-a-timeline-of-the-meteoric-rise-and-crash-of-ust-and-luna/">ended a bull run</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But why are they such a big deal?</p>
<h2>The Importance of Liquidity</h2>
<p>Ethereum is <a href="/home/ethereum/world-computer">the World Computer</a>. <a href="/home/ethereum/world-computer/de-fi">De-Fi</a> is the <a href="/home/ethereum/world-computer/de-fi/internet-economy">economy of the internet</a>.</p>
<p>On The World Computer, <a href="/home/concepts/liquidity">liquidity</a> is bandwidth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Liquidity is sustenance. Liquidity is rocket fuel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Liquidity is King.</p>
<p>Think very simply: liquidity is the measure of the amount of an asset you can buy or sell without causing slippage.</p>
<p>What is slippage? It’s the difference between what you expect out of a trade based on exchange rates and what you actually get.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>10 $ETH trading at $2k = $20K</li>
  <li>Pool A: FRAX:ETH with $1MM of both, total of $2MM</li>
  <li>Pool B: FRAX:ETH with $10k of both, total of $20k</li>
</ul>
<p>A can support your trade but B literally doesn’t have the FRAX.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order for B to execute your trade, the price will slip.</p>
<p>Let's say you're a new DAO trying to bootstrap growth. Maybe you want to buy some strategic assets or &nbsp;you need to pay your devs.</p>
<p>Your ability to convert your token into treasury funds is dictated by its liquidity. Too little, and selling funds will destroy your price.</p>
<p>This isn't just about traders &amp; DAOs, liquidity has existential implications for all</p>
<p>Without deep, perfuse liquidity, <a href="https://blog.makerdao.com/the-market-collapse-of-march-12-2020-how-it-impacted-makerdao/">liquidations can create crashes</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A liquidation too large will slip. AFTER it slips, the new price is set, thus the spiral begins</p>
<h2>Projecting Liquidity</h2>
<p>By its nature, liquidity has two components: the base asset (the asset you are interested in) and the quote asset (the asset you are trading against).</p>
<p>In the real world, liquidity is quoted against fiat currency.</p>
<p>Stablecoins attempt to mimic this behavior on-chain. To provide an asset that has a universally accepted value, stably stores value over time and can be used as a medium of exchange.</p>
<p>Stablecoins are the medium of exchange that protocols use to project liquidity.</p>
<p>Aave has billions held in its smart contracts, but these assets are illiquid. GHO allows Aave to make the liquidity available to De-Fi without exposing its TVL.</p>
<p>Aave has increased the liquidity available to De-Fi and is rewarded for it (via GHO interest payments)</p>
<p>In a lot of ways, FRAX is the same thing. Instead of user deposits, Frax Finance uses FRAX to project the liquidity of its protocol owned assets.</p>
<p>To issue a stablecoin is to return liquidity back to De-Fi without sacrificing TVL.</p>
<p>So yes, I do think we are entering a world of thousands and thousands of stablecoins... but that isn't a world that scares me.</p>
<p>For starters, we are building a system specifically designed to efficiently transfer value between stablecoins.</p>
<p>But more importantly, while I think that while overwhelming stablecoin choices will be a reality, I don't think it will be noticed.</p>
<h2>A Stablecoin Future</h2>
<p>Grandma wont hold dpxUSD, VST, or even FRAX in her wallet... In fact, I'd be surprised she's even heard of them.</p>
<p>We are still so early. Everything you see today is not meant for human eyes. If it happens on-chain, it is meant for protocols, other chains and other non-human consumers.</p>
<p>When it's time for grandma, it will all be hidden under 5 layers of <a href="/home/concepts/abstraction">abstraction</a>.</p>
<p>Let me put it this way:</p>
<p>Grandma has no idea what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite">TCP/IP</a> is, but she has no issues using her iPhone to go on Facebook.</p>
<p>I'm not saying she will ever be able to tell you what FRAX is. But I promise you that when she's clicking buttons, FRAX will be changing wallets.</p>
<p>So when I see another stablecoin announcement, I'm not nervous; the more the merrier.</p>
<p>For you stablecoin newcomers, here's some advice:</p>
<p>- <a href="https://curve.substack.com/p/june-22-2022-bulls-on-parade-">make sure to secure your stablecoin bull twitter handle</a></p>
<p>- pair with FRAXBP (Frax Finance will pay your voting incentives for you)</p>
