<h1 style="text-align:center;">DAOs and Governance</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>Decentralization is a big word that refers to a lot of things, and there are a countless number of DAOs out there, all doing something unique. These are just my thoughts from my one limited, biased corner of the internet.</i></p>
<h2>Ethereum and Innovation</h2>
<p>A long time ago, the first ape climbed down from a tree and man was born.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few millennia, and <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin">Vitalik Buterin</a> gave us <a href="/home/ethereum/world-computer">Ethereum, The World Computer</a>.</p>
<p>Now in 2022, we are all trying to figure out how to build on it. Or really, how to work together on it.</p>
<p>First and most importantly, we must recognize that the nature of innovation and progress is messy. While you’re experiencing it, it’s easy to feel like everything is awful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it’s important to examine what’s working and what’s not as we build towards the future.</p>
<h2>The DAO Playbook</h2>
<p>Every protocol is doing something bespoke, but in general most organizations follow a similar playbook:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>quiet development by a core team, funded by early investors</li>
  <li>initial distribution event, tapering emissions</li>
  <li>transfer of responsibility to community</li>
</ul>
<p>The transfer of responsibility to token holders is perhaps the most important but least understood factor in this process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without responsibility, what is the purpose of a governance token?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why would anyone buy it and why would anyone want to hold it?</p>
<p>So the early builders took a page from the analog world and said “a token has a value like a stock has a value.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokens were invested with governance power and with it the right to vote and help shape the future of the protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your protocol.</p>
<p>For a lot of protocols, this comes from a genuine and an admirable place; these are the ideas of democracy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In practice, we’ve seen a chaotic system, confusing results and a lot of questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example…</p>
<h3>MakerDAO</h3>
<p>On June 30, 2022, <a href="https://twitter.com/LucaProsperi">Luca Prosperi</a> <a href="https://dirtroads.substack.com/p/-42-valkyrie-makerdao-and-our-side?r=k87cd&amp;s=w&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">told us his side of the controversial MakerDAO vote</a> that took place at the end of June.</p>
<p>When all is said and done, the results are on-chain for all to see… But Luca’s tale shows the chain doesn’t capture everything.</p>
<h3>Rari Capital</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/04/30/defi-lender-rari-capitalfei-loses-80m-in-hack/">The tragic hack</a> of <a href="https://www.rari.capital/">Rari Capital</a> (<a href="https://fei.money/">FEI Protocol</a>) led to a <a href="https://decrypt.co/110102/tribe-dao-votes-repay-rari-capital-hack-victims-again">round of yes/no votes that left me with whiplash</a>… I can’t begin to imagine what it might have felt like to be a depositor.</p>
<p>Again, on-chain certainty has us in real world chaos.</p>
<h3>Wonderland.fi</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/155433/wonderland-passes-vote-to-invest-25-million-in-sifu-vision?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">[no comment]</a></p>
<h2>Decentralization Theater</h2>
<p>There have been enough of these incidents, high profile and small, that a lot of people believe there’s no real democracy here.</p>
<p>Most of what we are seeing is decentralization theater indented for two purposes: regulatory cover and community shaping.</p>
<h3>Regulatory Cover</h3>
<p>Regulation uncertainty has left a lot of questions…&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Which tokens count as securities? Commodities?</li>
  <li>Who is liable?</li>
  <li>Who is making money off this?</li>
  <li>Who gets to tax what for how much?</li>
</ul>
<p>Until we get requirements, “decentralization” is our answer to these questions.</p>
<h3>Community Shaping</h3>
<p>At the same time, decentralization is used to build and shape communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investors are much more passionate when they are “contributing”. Analysts are happy when they are given “open” access. Trolls are quieter when they’ve been “promoted” to private discord channels.</p>
<h2>Tail Risks</h2>
<p>The problem isn’t just decentralization theater, we’ve also seen true decentralization hit some catastrophic edge cases.</p>
<h3>Beanstalk</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/18/23030754/beanstalk-cryptocurrency-hack-182-million-dao-voting">One of the more famous (and more sad)</a> examples is <a href="https://bean.money/">Beanstalk</a>. Their devotion to decentralization and led them to put all decision-making on chain.</p>
<p>Mistakes were made, lessons learned, code has been fixed, and the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/02/beanstalk-stablecoin-protocol-barn-raise-aims-to-restore-77m-in-lost-funds/">barn is being raised again</a>.</p>
<p>But the cost was huge.</p>
<h3>Merit Circle DAO</h3>
<p>Or how about the case of <a href="https://meritcircle.io/">Merit Circle DAO</a>? The community decided their investor <a href="https://yieldguild.io/">Yield Guild</a> sucks (paraphrasing) and to rug them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite real contracts.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/itstimconnors/status/1536734104422522881">I don’t know exactly what happened but (I think) YGG got $.32 on the dollar</a>.</p>
<h3>RomeDAO</h3>
<p>But perhaps the best way to wrap it up is from the team at <a href="https://twitter.com/housesempronia">House of Sempronia:</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://blockworks.co/news/house-of-sempronias-departure-from-dao-sparks-further-concerns-over-dao-governance">Building things in a DAO is a disaster and we encourage no teams to go down this path.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So look, I’m just going to be frank with you. I don’t really believe in DAOs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some are a lot closer to the ideal, some are blatant shams, but the ones that survive are the ones who know how to manage a community and know how to whip a vote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it even needs whipping.</p>
<p>Eventually I can see governance tokens as stocks and DAOs as corporations;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1542196610775629824">Hasu has already laid out the path</a>.</p>
<p>Once we make these changes and take the best parts of corp-fi, THEN we can build our new ideas of governance and democracy.</p>
<p>…What was that about liability?</p>
<p>Until then, there is a type of governance I’m bullish on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is The World Computer, we can iterate on all of the traditional ideas… but we can also build new primitives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can build <a href="/home/ethereum/world-computer/de-fi/programmable-money">programmable money</a>.</p>
<p>The best example is the <a href="/home/ethereum/world-computer/de-fi/programmable-money/ve-tokens">system developed by Curve Finance and Convex Finance</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>veCRV has votes. Votes decide emissions. Emissions have a monetary value. Therefore, vote have a monetary value.</p>
<p>One that the market can express!</p>
<p>So when people ask me what I think about the current state of governance in crypto, I give the annoying answer: “it depends.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>DAO-style governance?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have faith, but I don’t believe we’re there today.</p>
<p>Market-based and automated protocol operations?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Science fiction tech!!</p>
