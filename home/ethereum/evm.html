<h1 style="text-align:center;">Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</h1>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<h3>Virtual Machine</h3>
<p>A <a href="/home/background/mass-comm/computer">Virtual Machine</a> (VM) is a computer program that emulates a complete, independent computer system entirely within another computing environment. Instead of developing software for a specific machine or type of machine, a VM allows development into a neutral environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine running a copy of Windows as an application on your Mac.</p>
<p>The computing environment offered by the VM will be exactly the same, regardless of what real-world computer it is running on.</p>
<p>VMs are nearly as old as modern computing; today they have many uses across nearly every use of technology.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Shared Platform</h2>
<p>Regardless of how varied the application, the through-line is the same: VMs provide a uniform computing platform across an unpredictable range of hardware.</p>
<p>Our discussions thus far have discussed VMs from the perspective of developers, but now let's take a different look.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's think about what a uniform computing platform means for consumers.</p>
<p>A basic VM is a single program that exists on a specific computer. It provides an environment with the exact same rules as any other copy, but it doesn't provide the SAME environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we are both running the same VM and I save a document on mine, it wont appear in yours.</p>
<p>Now let's imagine world where VMs can actually provide the SAME environment.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Credibly Neutral Rules</h2>
<p>There's a lot of reasons why we would be interested in this, but I stay focused on the most important: If you exist within the same environment, you know you share the same constraints.</p>
<p>Anyone who choses to enter the VM has implicitly decided to follow the rules set forth by the VM.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No special hardware (and performance edge), no special access, no administrative privilege.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <a href="/home/concepts/credible-neutrality">credibly neutral</a> environment for all that enter.</p>
<p>At this point it's time to bring in the hero of our story: the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).</p>
<h2>Ethereum Virtual Machine</h2>
<p><a href="/home/ethereum/evm/state-machine">Deep Dive: Ethereum State Machine</a></p>
<p>The EVM is the computing platform of Ethereum, kept alive by the Ethereum network and enshrined in the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>Together, these 3 parts form the World Computer.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, is a Turing-complete distributed state machine - but don't worry about this specific classification.</p>
<p>The purpose of the greater Ethereum apparatus is to offer a single shared computing platform in a manner that is secure, decentralized and permanently open for ALL.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone with an internet connection (and gas money) can interact with the World Computer.</p>
<h2>Inside the EVM</h2>
<h3>Entities</h3>
<p>Within the EVM, there are a few entities:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Accounts - representing real people who are using the World Computer<ul>
      <li><a href="/home/ethereum/evm/account">Deep Dive: Ethereum Accounts</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Contracts - representing a program that exists inside the EVM.<ul>
      <li>Contracts are accounts that are controlled by the code</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Objects - representing tokens, NFTs and anything else that can be represented within the EVM<ul>
      <li>remember, the EVM is <a href="/home/concepts/turing-complete">Turing-complete</a>; any object can be represented in the EVM</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ETH - the fuel/electricity/energy/currency of the World Computer</li>
</ul>
<h3>Properties</h3>
<p>The EVM has these critical properties:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Everything the EVM does is recorded into blocks and is added to the (public) blockchain</li>
  <li>Anything recorded in the blockchain cannot be undone</li>
  <li>All objects have owners and cannot be altered without the permission of their owner</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the EVM provides a generalized, credibly neutral computing environment with a native notion of property.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A Single EVM</h2>
<p>After we understand what the EVM is, the next question is simple... in fact it has been hanging over us for a while now:&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do you get share one single instance of the EVM across multiple different computers... let alone the globe?</p>
<p>The obvious solution is to just run a single copy of the EVM and let everyone log in. Maybe in an infinitely scalable cloud computing platform, maybe in a wholly-owned server farm maintained by the Ethereum Foundation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem solved?</p>
<p>Let's remember the EVM's 3 critical properties:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>compulsory (public) record keeping</li>
  <li>immutable history</li>
  <li>equal access</li>
</ul>
<p>If we run a centralized EVM, we can't guarantee any of these; we are always relying on the good faith of the people running the computers.</p>
<p>Maybe the custodians are acting in good faith today, and maybe they continue in perpetuity, always doing their best effort to enact these properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alas, regardless of how hard they try, they will always fail in the third. They will always have privileged access.</p>
<h2>Decentralization</h2>
<p>Instead of centralizing the EVM, what if we did the opposite?&nbsp;</p>
<p>What if we let anyone access it by running a copy at home and then syncing it up to the rest of them?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The blockchain provides a record of everything that happened so far, a fresh EVM can just catch up.</p>
<p>Boot up the EVM, skip through the blockchain and you're good to go! The moment you're in sync, you're tapped into the World Computer!&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Staying in Sync</h3>
<p>...now how do we progress it forward?&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do thousands of independent EVMs ensure they all make the exact same move at the same time?</p>
<p>In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto gave us a path forward, but it wasn't until Vitalik Buterin launched Ethereum in 2015 that we had a true solution.</p>
<p>But that's a story for next time; the story of EVM consensus.</p>
<p>That's the magic of blockchain technology!</p>
