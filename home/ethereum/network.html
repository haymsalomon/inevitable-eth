<h1 style="text-align:center;">Ethereum Network</h1>
<h2>The World Computer</h2>
<p>Ethereum is the <a href="https://inevitableeth.com/home/ethereum/world-computer">World Computer</a>, a single, globally shared computing platform that exists in the space between a network of 1,000s of computers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://inevitableeth.com/home/ethereum/evm">Ethereum Virtual Machine</a> (EVM) &nbsp;provides the computing environment, the <a href="/home/ethereum/blockchain">blockchain</a> provides a permanent, transparent record of the World Computer's activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The network is the group of real world computers (nodes) that run the software that both executes the EVM and produces the blockchain.</p>
<h2>A Network of Nodes</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="/node-banner.jpeg"></figure>
<p><a href="https://inevitableeth.com/home/ethereum/network/node">Deep Dive: Nodes</a></p>
<p>You can think of a node in two ways: a real-world computer or the group of software needed to access, validate and otherwise run the World Computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nodes are both the physical machines running the Ethereum and the real-world <a href="/home/ethereum/network/node/accessing-ethereum">access points to the World Computer</a>. Users access Ethereum by sending transactions directly to nodes.</p>
<p>Under the hood, a node is actually two independent pieces of software: a consensus client and an execution client.</p>
<p>Think like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Consensus client: responsible for Proof of Stake (PoS), securing Ethereum with the value of ETH</li>
  <li>Execution client: responsible for operating the computing platform of the World Computer (the EVM).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ethereum Block Production</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="/network-1.png"></figure>
<p>As The World Computer executes <a href="/home/ethereum/blockchain/transaction">transactions</a>, it records the changes in the EVM and reports it as a <a href="/home/ethereum/blockchain/block">block</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each node is executing this process locally, coordinating with the network and progressing in lockstep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We begin with the blockchain, from which the EVM can load everything into memory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From there it can begin transacting. Potential transactions are chosen from the mempool and bundled together. The EVM then executes all bundled transactions, producing a potential block. The potential block is then sent to the network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other nodes inspect and approve the potential block, adding it to their copy of the EVM and blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The network must maintain uniform execution across tens of thousands of nodes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All must progress together, one block at a time</p>
<h2>Keeping the Network in Sync</h2>
<p><a href="/home/ethereum/network/consensus">Deep Dive: Consensus Systems</a></p>
<p>Consensus is the process by which all the nodes coordinate, stay in sync and create economic security.</p>
<p>Previously, the Ethereum network uses Proof of Work (PoW) to coordinate. However, in September 2022 Ethereum transitioned to Proof of Stake (PoS).</p>
<p>Let's briefly discuss PoW.</p>
<h2>Proof of Work</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="/network-2.png"></figure>
<p>Under PoW, nodes (miners) compete to solve <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/mining-algorithms/ethash/">puzzles generated by the current state of the blockchain</a>.</p>
<p>The first miner to solve the puzzle broadcasts the block they produced to the network, who verify the block and then add it to their copy of the blockchain.</p>
<p>Then everyone begins the next puzzle.</p>
<p>Read about Ethash to learn more about these puzzles. Just know that they are difficult to solve but easy to verify.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="/home/ethereum/network/consensus/PoW-vs-PoS">There are many reasons why Proof of Stake is a superior system</a>. Perhaps most importantly, the way this system works is winner take all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only the first miner with the correct solution is rewarded. Every other node discards their work and starts on the next one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only is everyone else’s effort trashed, it’s responsible for all that energy waste.</p>

<h2>Proof of Stake</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="/network-4.png"></figure>
<p><a href="/home/ethereum/network/consensus/pos">Deep Dive: Ethereum Proof of Stake</a></p>
<p>PoS begins with a commitment by every node (validator): “I will play by the rules.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>But this is the internet, we don’t rely on promises from anonymous IP addresses. Ethereum PoS requires a pledge of collateral.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something at stake.</p>
<p>In PoS, a validator is chosen at random, becoming the block producer.</p>
<p>The <a href="/home/ethereum/network/consensus/block-proposal">block producer chooses transactions from the mempool (or elsewhere), constructs a block and sends it to the network</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Validators <a href="/home/ethereum/network/consensus/attestation">attest to the validity of the new block</a>, adding it to the blockchain.</p>
<p>Proposals are rewarded with a lot of $ETH, attestations with a little.</p>
<p>The network is made of nodes, each of which can support multiple validators. A validator has exactly 32 ETH at stake.</p>
<p>Deploying more validators means a better chance to be selected as block proposer.</p>
<p>My favorite analogy is a running race.</p>
<ul>
  <li>PoW is a brutal competition between every athlete, from little Jimmy to Usain Bolt. 1st gets the prize, 2nd-last get nothing.</li>
  <li>PoS is an agreement to take turns and to share the winnings, enforced by a claim on your bank account.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Future on the World Computer</h2>
<p>Ethereum is The World Computer, native to the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EVM and the blockchain speak to The World Computer. Consensus systems speak to internet native, coordinating trustlessly and progressing in unison.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The future is in the applications you build on top of it!</p>
