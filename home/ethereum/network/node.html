<h1 style="text-align:center;">Ethereum Node</h1>
<h2>The World Computer</h2>
<p>Ethereum is <a href="/home/ethereum/world-computer">the World Computer</a>, a single, globally shared computing platform that exists in the space between a network of 1,000s of computers (nodes).</p>
<p>Think of a node as a physical computer in the real world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many people, myself included, use a machine like this one. (you can also run a node on a cloud provider, like AWS or Google Cloud, but they are indistinguishable for our purposes).</p>

<h2>Validators</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="/node-body-1.jpeg"></figure>
<p>A node is both computer and the atomic unit of the Ethereum network.</p>
<p>Once running, a node operator can stake ETH, become a validator and participating in Proof of Stake (PoS).</p>
<p>Staking is done in 32 $ETH increments, but a single node can support many validators.</p>
<h2>Inside a Node</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="/node-body-2.jpeg"></figure>
<p>Zooming into the computer, the node is actually two independent pieces of software: a consensus client and an execution client.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are 5 consensus clients and 5 execution clients, any combination will make a node.</p>

<h2>The Merge</h2>
<p>Before the Merge, you could think of Ethereum as two independent (closely tracking) blockchains: mainnet and the beacon chain.</p>
<p>Mainnet tracked all the changes within the <a href="/home/ethereum/evm">Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</a>, and was previously secured by Proof of Work (PoW). This chain was run by execution clients.</p>
<p>The beacon chain was launched in 2020, 5 years after the launch of Ethereum. Its purpose it to contain all the logic needed operate Proof of Stake (PoS). This chain was run by consensus clients.</p>
<p>In mid-September 2022, the two chains of Ethereum went from "closely tracking" to one single chain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mainnet (now called the execution chain) replaced the security guarantees offered by PoW for the security of the beacon chain.</p>
<p>And the beacon chain is secured by $ETH.</p>
<h2>Speaking to the Network</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="/node-body-3.jpeg"></figure>
<p>The Merge is very much reflected in the Ethereum we have today.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each node runs two, independent, pieces of software.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>These clients communicate directly with other like-clients in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>They communicate to each other within each node.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the hood Ethereum actually two networks... it just so happens that both networks exist between the same nodes.</p>
<h2>JSON-RPC</h2>
<p>Within a node, the consensus and execution client communicate via a remote procedure call (RPC) protocol (specifically using the JSON data format, so JSON-RPC). JSON-RPC is an <a href="/home/concepts/api">API</a> that defines both the data structures and the rules for processing them.</p>
<p>You may have seen the term JSON-RPC before, maybe while clicking through your crypto wallet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The interface by which consensus clients communicate with execution clients is the same interface by which your wallet interacts with the EVM in order to create a transactions.</p>
<p>In fact that's exactly how you should understand your wallet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, it is (probably) communicating with a centralized service like Alchemy or Infura. These companies run nodes locally and then allow people to interact with them over the web.</p>
<p>In the future, your wallet will have an embedded light client, and will be able to connect to Ethereum directly.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In summary, an Ethereum node is a real computer that runs two pieces of software: an execution client and a consensus client.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The former is responsible for the EVM, the later for PoS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They communicate internally via an API, but work in their own P2P networks.</p>
