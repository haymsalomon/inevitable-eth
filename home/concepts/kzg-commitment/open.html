<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<h3>Elliptic Curve Cryptography</h3>
<p>Elliptic curve cryptography looks unapproachable, but it's totally understandable with a decent amount of high school algebra.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check out this <a href="https://inevitableeth.com/home/concepts/elliptic-curve-cryptography">Into to Elliptic Curve Cryptography</a> and you'll have the math you need to get through this article.</p>
<h2>Notation</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="/kzg-open-3.jpeg"></figure>
<p>At this point our graphic has become too cluttered to be useful, so we will simplify in the name of readability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing has changed, we are still working in modular arithmetic.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>KZG Commitment Scheme</h2>
<p><a href="/home/concepts/polynomial-commitment">Deep Dive: Polynomial Commitment Schemes</a></p>
<p>A polynomial commitment scheme allows one party to publicly commit to a specific dataset without giving away any info about the underlying data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once a commitment has been calculated, the data is locked in; any changes to the data will result in invalid proof generation.</p>
<p>A KZG polynomial commit can be "opened" with any data point without revealing the entire dataset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's say I am thinking of 10 words. I write them each down on different pieces of paper. If you guess correct, i ONLY show you the correct 1 (keeping the other 9 hidden).</p>
<h3>KZG Commitments Part 1: Commit</h3>
<p><a href="/home/concepts/kzg-commitment/commit">Deep Dive: KZG Commitments Part 1 - Commit</a></p>
<p>First, we generate a polynomial from our data using a mathematical process called a Lagrange Interpolation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, we calculate the value of this polynomial evaluated with a secret number S (hidden within an elliptic curve).</p>
<p>Once the commitment is calculated, the prover is bound to this specific data. The scheme is going to pivot around this specific value, derived from this specific polynomial.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A change to even a single bit will result in a brand new polynomial (and therefore commit value).</p>
<h2>Opening a Commitment</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="/kzg-open-4.jpeg"></figure>
<p>Now that the prover has been bound to this specific set of data, we can test the commitment by opening a proof at singular piece of data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The verifier, an independent entity who may or may not have access to the entire dataset, now chooses a piece of data to verify.</p>
<p>Let z be the piece of data the verifier is going to test... and so he sends z over to the prover.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, the prover calculates f(z).&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is very easy for the prover; he has already built the polynomial in order to generate the commitment. He simply runs z through.</p>
<h2>Dividing Polynomials</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="/kzg-open-5.jpeg"></figure>
<p>We are going to hand wave through the math, but <a href="https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/dividing-polynomials/">here's a great resource to learn more</a>.</p>
<p>tl;dr you can divide polynomials. It's not a particularly complicated operation, in fact it (can) look like long division.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because the prover has built the polynomial, it is very easy for them to create the new polynomial h(x).&nbsp;</p>
<p>h(x) is the quotient polynomial built off of our proof data z.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="/kzg-open-6.jpeg"></figure>
<p>The important takeaway: the verifier provides a value (a piece of data in the dataset to which the prover is committed) around which the prover is going to create an elliptic curve point and one other value.</p>
<p>And that's it! Our commitment is open and the prover has created all the pieces that the verifier needs to verify the proof!&nbsp;</p>
