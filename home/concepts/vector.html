<h1 style="text-align:center;">Vectors</h1>
<h2>Mathematical Vectors</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="/vector-2.png"></figure>
<p>A vector is a concept used to convey quantities that cannot be expressed by a single number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think about velocity, which is a mathematician's way of saying "speed plus direction."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speed is 10 m/s. Velocity is 10 m/s in a north-west direction.</p>
<h2>Vector Notation</h2>
<p>Vectors are incredibly versatile and show up again and again across mathematics. There are many different ways to express a vector, each having their own benefits and drawbacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are just a few of the ways we can express the same information.</p>

<h2>Multi-Dimensional Vectors</h2>
<p>Below is an example of a 3-dimensional vector.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/vector-4.png"></figure>
<p>This is as far as the human brain can visualize, but mathematical dimensions can continue far beyond 3; they can go arbitrarily high.</p>
<p>A vector in n-dimensional space can hold up to n data points, one piece of data in each dimension.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The easiest way to see this is in the (v_0, v_1, ... , v_n) notation. Each dimension provides capacity to store an extra point of data.</p>
<p>Now you might be asking yourself "ok, I understand that we can put data into a vector, but why would I want to?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, vectors are mathematical primitives. They are incredibly powerful because they can be programmatically manipulated.</p>
<h2>Vectors in Computer Science</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="/vector-5.png"></figure>
<p>Think about 3D space, a vector just looks like an arrow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take two arrows, place them tip-to-tip. Draw a new arrow from the start of the first one to the end of the second.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You've just done vector addition!</p>
<p>This is the end of our short intro to vectors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For now, all you need to remember is simple: vectors allow us to store an arbitrary amount of data in a way that can be mathematically manipulated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now let's go look at where we see them in use!</p>
