<h1 style="text-align:center;">Power Law</h1>
<h2>Simple Example</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="/power-law-square.jpeg"></figure>
<p>Consider a square with sides of length X. An increase in side length results in:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>the perimeter changing by a linear factor (multiplied by 4)</li>
  <li>the area changing by a proportional factor (multiplied by X)</li>
</ul>
<p>The relationship of the area to side length is a power law.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law">Power Law relationship</a> is one in which a change in one thing can lead to a large change in the other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Written as an equation, a power law relationship fits this form: Y = MXᴮ, with M and B are constants. A small change in X results in a proportionally large change in Y.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Linear Relationships</h3>
<p>If B = 1, the relationship is linear.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>to double a cake recipe, you need twice as much flour</li>
  <li>to drive twice as far it will take twice as long.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Linear relationships, in which twice-as-big requires twice-as-much, are simple and intuitive.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Nonlinear Relationships</h3>
<p>Nonlinear relationships are more complicated; small effects can produce incredibly amplified (B &gt; 1) or dampened (B &lt; 1) changes in a systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, fortunately or not, the universe tends to manifest as nonlinear relationships.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>Take, for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleiber%27s_law">Keibler's law</a>, which states that animal’s metabolic rate increases at three-fourths of the power of the animal’s weight (mass). If a rabbit weighs one 100x as much as a mouse, the rabbit’s metabolic rate will be 32 times the mouse’s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turns out the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6288094/">earth's trees also follow a power law distribution</a>: although close to one third of the planet is covered by forest, more than half (54%) of the world's forests are found in 5 countries.</p>

<h2>Pareto Principle</h2>
<p>But if nature seems partial to power law relationships, humans are much more obsessed. Through the lens of statistics, almost everything we build ends up with a non-linear distribution: Income/wealth, internet content generation, frequency of words, city size, even wars!</p>
<p>In fact, this phenomena is so prevalent and important that economist have built a whole branch of study around it. But we'll just sum it up with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto Principle</a>: For many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes.</p>

<p>The power law, named because exponential equations describe severely unequal distributions, is the law of the universe. It defines our surroundings so completely that we usually don’t even see it.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Mathematical Models</h2>
<p>To be clear, the power law and Pareto principal are not written rules. They are mental models that describe a huge amount of the phenomena that exists on the earth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each example is a consequence of specific conditions, but can be articulated by a common idea.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"All models are wrong, but some are useful."&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>George Box, statistician</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Even though statistical, financial or mental models always fall short of the complexities of reality, they can still be useful nonetheless.</p>
<p>As you continue on your crypto journey, keep an eye out for examples of power law relationships; you will find PLENTY.&nbsp;</p>
