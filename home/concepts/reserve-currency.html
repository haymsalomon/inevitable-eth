<h1 style="text-align:center;">Reserve Currency</h1>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>A reserve currency is one that:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Has the depth and <a href="/home/concepts/liquidity">liquidity</a> to allow for reliable and efficient international transactions</li>
  <li>Can be freely and easily exchanged for other currencies</li>
  <li>Is held by many monetary authorities and institutions, in significant amounts</li>
</ul>
<p>Central banks and major financial institutions regularly do 8+ figure transactions across international borders, requiring huge amounts of liquidity. Reserve currencies are held in large sums used to settle these transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reserve currencies help facilitate global trade and provide a stable store of value</p>
<h3>Store of Value</h3>
<p>A store of value is an asset that can be saved, retrieved, and exchanged in the future without deteriorating in value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Argentina, Turkey and many other countries regularly face annual inflation above 50%. Citizens will often save by holding reserve currency notes (USD). Holding a reserve currency minimizes exchange rate risk, as the purchasing nation/institution will not have to exchange its currency for the current reserve currency to make the purchase. A large percentage of commodities are priced in the reserve currency.</p>
<h2>Global Reserve Currencies</h2>
<h3>A Brief History</h3>
<p>The world's reserve currencies (since the late middle ages):&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Venetian ducat/Forentine florin</li>
  <li>Spanish silver dollar</li>
  <li>Dutch guilder</li>
  <li>British pound sterling</li>
  <li>American dollar</li>
</ol>
<p>The British pound achieved reserve status on the heels of the United Kingdom's global empire - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_empires">the largest in history</a>. Over the 20th century, the British had remade their empire to be focus around central banking and the pound's reserve status.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After World War II, a broken British empire surrendered the financial network to the US; included was global reserve currency primacy.</p>
<h3>Current Status</h3>
<p>Today, ~60% of the world's reserves are held in US dollars. The Euro is second at 20%. Then Yen (5%) and RMB (5%).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The world's need for dollars has allowed the US government to borrow at lower costs, giving the United States an advantage in excess of $100B per year.</p>
<p>The top reserve currency is generally selected by the banking community for the strength and stability of the economy in which it is used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a currency becomes less stable, or its economy becomes less dominant, over time banks may abandon it for another currency.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Control the Reserve Currency</h2>
<p>And, self-fulfillingly, having control over a reserve currency is what allows capitalists to create dominant and stable economies&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, the US would not be able to save itself from the <a href="/home/background/gfc">Global Financial Crisis</a> in 2008 without control of the world's reserve currency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Control over the world's reserve currency was required to save the world from the Global Financial Crisis...&nbsp;</p>
<p>...and yet, the question must be asked: was the Global Financial Crisis even possible without control and exploitation of that system by American capitalists?&nbsp;</p>
<p>And there's one more power control over the world's reserve currency gives you, especially if you team up with #2. <a href="/home/background/sanctions">You can wield it as a weapon</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2010, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-dollar-reserves-un-idUSTRE65S40620100629">the UN called for abandoning the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency</a>. The report states that a new system should not be based on national currencies but foster international liquidity to create a more stable financial system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UN has its suggestions, I have my ideas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless, we both agree that we need to build a system with <a href="/home/concepts/credible-neutrality">credible neutrality</a>; a system that treats all participants equally, that does not discriminate or reward.</p>
