<h1 style="text-align:center;">Hash Functions</h1>
<p>The purpose of a hash function is to transform any amount of data into a compact, uniform value. The input can be of arbitrary length but the output is always the same length.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The length is decided by the hash function; it can be as small or large as desired.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hash functions have many different uses, but all uses rely on the same fundamental properties:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>quick and efficient to compute&nbsp;</li>
  <li>outputs should be randomly distributed between all possible outputs&nbsp;</li>
  <li>difficult (if not impossible) to reverse engineer an input from an output.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>If your hashing function has an output with 3 characters and you feed it 1MM pieces of data, much of it will result in the same output. However, if the output is long enough, a good hash function will have no collisions (two inputs resulting in the same output).&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a strong hashing function, we have the ability to take any data and compress it into a verifiable signature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the data is public, then anyone can recreate the signature and verify that the data matches its label. If the data is private, it can form the basis of identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any private information fed into a (good) hash function will instantly become lost but form the basis of a unique, un-replicable signature.&nbsp;</p>
