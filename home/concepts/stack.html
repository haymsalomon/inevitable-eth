<h2>Structured Data</h2>
<p>Let's start with some data - let's just pick 30 random words from the BIP-39 list (the words used for your seed phrases).</p>
<p>Here's the 30 I picked, presented in two ways: unstructured (words are there, but that's it) and structured (aligned, alphabetical order).</p>
<p>Both representations hold the exact same set of data, but one is significantly easier to work with.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/stack-1.png"></figure>
<p>For example, let's say I ask you for "the only word that begins with J" or "all 4 letter words," it's much easier to determine the answer from the structured data.</p>
<p>Here we can see a core principle of computer science: organizing data efficiently is critical to making efficient algorithms (and therefore programs).</p>
<p>And so, a sub-field of study has emerged: the science of abstract data types (ADT), or, more commonly, data structures.</p>
<p>When you think of a data structure, you should think in two parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the data contained within the data structure (the 30 words we chose)</li>
  <li>the container, relationships and functions that organize whatever data is put inside of it (aligned, alphabetical order).</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many different data structures, each with their own benefits and limitations; it is up to the programmer to choose the data structure that works best for the problem want to solve.</p>
<p>One of the most important data structures is called a stack.</p>
<h2>Stacks</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="/stack-2.png"></figure>
<p>Like an array, a stack is an ordered list of elements (data). In an array, you access each element using its index (its position within that list).</p>
<p>A stack is different, it does not allow access to all of the elements - just the last one.</p>
<p>Think about a stack of plates, say 10 plates high, and you want to add an 11th. There's only one position for you to put your plate - on top.</p>
<p>Now the stack has 11 plates, and you need one. You can only grab the plate on the top - the last one placed on the stack.</p>
<p>A stack is a data structure that operates by the "Last In, First Out" (LIFO) principle. A stack has 3 (main) operations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>push: add data to the stack</li>
  <li>pop: remove data from the stack</li>
  <li>peek: look at the data on the top of the stack (without removing it)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Simply Optimized</h3>
<p>As you can see, a stack is an incredibly lightweight (and inflexible) data structure. By giving up functionality (eg accessing arbitrary elements in an array), we make the stack as simple as possible.</p>
<p>And in computer science, simpler (often) means faster.</p>
<p>Let's return to arrays for a moment. The most important property of an array is that all the elements are stored next to each other.</p>
<p>When your computer wants to access data in the array, first it loads the beginning of the array, and then hops to the correct position.</p>
<p>With a stack, the computer doesn't need to worry about positioning at all; it just needs needs to keep track of the end of the stack.</p>
<p>Adding data? Look for the end of the stack and write new data. Need data? Look for the end of the stack and pull out the data.</p>
<p>In practice, the amount of overhead this saves on a single operation is negligible, but if you are working with enormous datasets with huge amounts of operations the savings add up.</p>
<p>In fact, this is more common than you might think...</p>
<h2>Stack Trivia</h2>
<p>A stack plays a very important roll is (the vast majority) of all computer programs: it holds all the information about an actively running application.</p>
<p>There's no need to dive deep here, every high level computer language (like Python) will hide this from you.</p>
<p>Still, there is a particular reason it's worth knowing that a computer application stores all of its operational memory (think "scratch-space") in a stack...</p>
<p>...there is an entire classification of error for when your application accidentally jumps out of its stack.</p>
<p>In fact, you've probably heard of it: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>!</p>
<p>(For the record, a stack underflow is when an application tries to access - peek/pop - a stack that is empty).</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>From a high level, that's everything you need to know about stacks. From here, it's time to look into arrays for the specific language you are working in.</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>
