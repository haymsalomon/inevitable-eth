<h2>Structured Data</h2>
<p>Let's start with some data - let's just pick 30 random words from the BIP-39 list (the words used for your seed phrases).</p>
<p>Here's the 30 I picked, presented in two ways: unstructured (words are there, but that's it) and structured (aligned, alphabetical order).</p>
<p>Both representations hold the exact same set of data, but one is significantly easier to work with.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/array-0.png"></figure>
<p>For example, let's say I ask you for "the only word that begins with J" or "all 4 letter words," it's much easier to determine the answer from the structured data.</p>
<p>Here we can see a core principle of computer science: organizing data efficiently is critical to making efficient algorithms (and therefore programs).</p>
<p>And so, a sub-field of study has emerged: the science of abstract data types (ADT), or, more commonly, data structures.</p>
<p>When you think of a data structure, you should think in two parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the data contained within the data structure (the 30 words we chose)</li>
  <li>the container, relationships and functions that organize whatever data is put inside of it (aligned, alphabetical order).</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many different data structures, each with their own benefits and limitations; it is up to the programmer to choose the data structure that works best for the problem want to solve.</p>
<p>And so, let's dive in! First up, let's start with the basics: an array.</p>
<h2>Arrays</h2>
<h2>Single Dimensional</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="/array-1.png"></figure>
<p>Let's say you are writing a program that needs to process 10 pieces of data (elements).</p>
<p>You could create a new variable that stores each individual piece of data, but then you'd need to keep track of 10 variables.</p>
<p>Or you could represent that same data as a single array.</p>
<p>An array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (data), each identified by at least one array index/key.</p>
<p>Each key directly corresponds with the position of its corresponding data element (eg the element in position 3 has key = 3).</p>
<p>The most basic kind of array is a single-dimensional array. Elements are listed in order and can be accessed using its position.</p>
<p>Most languages will use a notation like "array[14] = 'Lock'" to say "the element in position 14 is 'Lock'".</p>
<h3>Properties of Arrays</h3>
<p>We wont go too deep, but its useful to understand some of the underlying properties of an array.</p>
<p>The most important thing to understand is that an array in always set up so that each element is adjacent to each other in memory.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to storing the data in individual variables. Each time you instantiate a new variable, the computer will just give you whatever section in memory is free at that particular moment.</p>
<p>Accessing each element requires accessing arbitrary areas in memory.</p>
<p>When data is stored in an array, the computer doesn't have to spend all this overhead retrieving data from across the entire memory space it has access to.</p>
<p>It reaches into memory one time to find the beginning of the array and then can quickly and easily hop around.</p>
<p>Beyond this, arrays have different properties depending on the specific programming language you are working in.</p>
<p>Things to consider: is the array structure immutable (can you change its length)? What is the index of the first element (usually arrays start with 0)?</p>
<h3>Multi-Dimensional Arrays</h3>
<figure class="image"><img src="/array-2.png"></figure>
<p>Let's return to the concept we just explored: that arrays lay out their elements contiguously in memory.</p>
<p>The easiest way to conceptualize this is as a list, which is useful on its own. But using a little trick, we can greatly extend this basic data structure.</p>
<p>While machines have no need for dimensions, they are a very useful human construct for our inferior minds.</p>
<p>If an array is a contiguous block in memory, and can be thought of as a list, then we can stack two of them side by side to create a table.</p>
<p>And so, arrays can be extended into an arbitrary amount of dimensions, providing incredibly efficient and organized access to arbitrarily complex dataset.</p>
<p>Most languages will use a notation like "array[8][1] = 'Olive'" to say "the element in row 8, column 2 is 'Olive'".</p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>From a high level, that's everything you need to know about arrays. From here, it's time to look into arrays for the specific language you are working in.</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>
