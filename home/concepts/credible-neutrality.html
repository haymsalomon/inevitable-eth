<h1 style="text-align:center;">Credible Neutrality</h1>
<h2>A Partisan Casino</h2>
<p>Let's start with a hypothetical. Let's say you walk into a casino.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To your left is a completely normal game of blackjack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To your right is a game of poker... only in this game, the first person to sit down gets to look at everyone else's cards during the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This modification breaks the game. If one player can see every other card, s/he is guaranteed to control the game; see who is going to win the hand, bet accordingly. Unless they are (or can influence) the first player, no rational person would choose to play that game.</p>
<h2>Fairness</h2>
<p>The fundamental principle is fairness: are all individuals treated reasonably, consistently and equally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose: promote morality (or whatever).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The real purpose: people refuse to use or rely on systems they don't perceive as fair.</p>
<p>This idea becomes more important as the stakes of the system increase. You might be interested in playing modified-poker when the chips are valueless and the table is full of friends... but the decision changes entirely when the buy-in is 6 figures.</p>
<h2>Vitalik's Principle</h2>
<p>In 2020, Vitalik Buterin <a href="https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/">distilled this concept into this principle</a>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>When building mechanisms that decide high-stakes outcomes, it’s very important for those mechanisms to be credibly neutral.</p>
<p>A mechanism is a tool that takes in inputs from multiple people, and uses these inputs to make some kind of decision that people care about in a way that is consistent with its participants’ values.</p>
<p>A mechanism is an algorithm plus incentives.</p>

<h2>Believably Neutral</h2>
<p>A mechanism is credibly neutral if it does not discriminate for or against any specific people, treating everyone fairly, to the extent that it’s possible in today's diverse and complicated world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not just neutrality that is required here, it's credible neutrality. It is not enough for a mechanism to be fairly designed, it’s also vital that the mechanism convince a large and diverse group of people that it is fair (or at least makes basic efforts to be).&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should be easy to see just by looking at the mechanism's design.</p>

<h2>Credible Neutrality in Practice</h2>
<p>Mechanisms such as blockchains, political systems and social media are designed to facilitate cooperation across large, and diverse, groups of people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Credible neutrality is about both brining a new participant to a mechanism and keeping its retaining existing users.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Neutrality is about everyone seeing that the mechanism is fair.</li>
  <li>Credible is about everyone seeing that everyone can see that as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone participating wants to be sure that everyone else will not abandon the mechanism the next day.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Balancing Neutrality with Efficacy</h2>
<p>Of course, neutrality is never total. For example, capitalism discriminates in favor of concentrated interests and the wealthy, and against the poor and those who rely heavily on public goods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, credible neutrality isn't the only thing we care about; it’s very possible for a mechanism to be both credibly neutral and terrible.But, still, some mechanisms are much more neutral than others.</p>
<p>Thus, credible neutrality must be balanced against another idea, the principle of efficacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, if a credibly neutral mechanism has not yet been found, an biased mechanism should be adopted in the short term.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But recognizing credible neutrality as something that is valuable, and striving to get closer to that ideal, is important.</p>
<h2>Legitimacy</h2>
<p>Credible neutrality is a systems design principle. The goal is to create systems that are well understood to be fair and provide a level playing field.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we build credibly neutral systems, we are building for the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are building legitimacy.</p>
