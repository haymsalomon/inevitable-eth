<h1 style="text-align:center;">Working Capital</h1>
<h2>Manufacturing Cycles</h2>
<p>Alright, let’s talk product manufacturing cycles. At a super high level, here’s one one cycle looks like:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>buy raw materials&nbsp;</li>
  <li>manufacture product&nbsp;</li>
  <li>sell product, get revenue&nbsp;</li>
  <li>subtract revenue from cost of materials, book profit&nbsp;</li>
  <li>repeat</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I’m not going to pretend that producing a product or a service is as simple as that. But what I will tell you is that finance has completely changed the way we manage the money for that process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This concept is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_capital">Working Capital</a>.</p>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p>Assets - stuff you own &amp; money owed to you.</p>
<p>Liabilities - money you owe.</p>
<h3>Net Working Capital</h3>
<p>Net Working Capital (NWC): the capital of a business which is used in its day-to-day trading operations, calculated as the current assets minus the current liabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think like this:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>You have $100&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Alice owes you $50&nbsp;</li>
  <li>You owe Bob $125&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Your NWC: $100. You can use that $100 as long as you have $125 ready when you need to pay Bob back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now fast forward and the debts have been settled:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;You have $25&nbsp;</li>
  <li>No outstanding debt&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Your NWC: $25</p>
<h3>Payment Terms</h3>
<p>Payment terms: number of days a business has after goods are exchanged to pay&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think like this:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>You are building/selling cars and need glass for windows&nbsp;</li>
  <li>You buy $100 of glass from Charlie&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Charlie delivers the glass today&nbsp;</li>
  <li>You pay $100 Charlie in 15 days</li>
</ul>
<p>Think about manufacturing in the real world. It takes time to transform raw materials into a product, move it out into the world and collect revenue.</p>
<p>Payment terms are an economic innovation that unlocks the liquidity inherent in the capital locked in real world production</p>
<h3>Payables &amp; Receivables</h3>
<p>Payable: short term debt a company owes for goods/services&nbsp;</p>
<p>Receivable: short term credit a company is owed for for goods/services&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think like this:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>You sell clothes&nbsp;</li>
  <li>You owe Dennis $50 for wool/materials (payable)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Eleanor bought a coat, but will pay $75 next week (receivable)</li>
</ul>
<p><br>That’s all the vocab we need to know for this thread, let’s pull it together:</p>
<ul>
  <li>net working capital: funds available to an organization for daily operations&nbsp;</li>
  <li>payment terms: the time between delivery of goods and payment&nbsp;</li>
  <li>payable/receivable: short term borrowing/lending</li>
</ul>
<h2><br>Coordinating Trade</h2>
<p>In an ideal world, you want to sell your product and then pay your suppliers. Revenue pays off the cost of creating the good and you keep the profit. And (between you &amp; me) you might not be able to afford the cost of the materials until after the product sells.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, regardless of if you sell your product or not, your supplier sold his product to you. He wants his cash ASAP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Likewise, whoever you sold your product too wants as much time as possible to pay you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are millions of businesses in the world, all with specific needs and ambitions. They all negotiate (mostly) bilateral deals trying to measure their needs with their counter-parties’ limitations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is (a part of) the foundation of the financial economy.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Value of Payment Terms</h2>
<p>The financial economy is distinct from the real economy.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Real economy - production, transportation and consumption of goods and services&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Financial economy - manipulation of the flows of capital following in the real economy.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Example, imagine two almost identical companies who sell breakfast cereal, A and B. Both produce a box for $1 and sell it for $3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both companies:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>buy materials - produce cereal (7 days)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>sell/transport/deliver cereal (14 days)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>A has negotiated “ideal” payment terms: 21 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Production time is 7 days, sales cycle is 14 days. A pays supplier in 21 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When A produces and sells a box of cereal, they don’t need to pay for the grain, packaging, etc. until they receive payment for the finished good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>B is… more aggressive. Using its superior powers of negotiation (read: monopoly and monopsony power) to make more favorable deals.</p>
<p>B's payment terms: 121 days.</p>
<p>Cereal price: $3, Cereal production cost: $1</p>
<ul>
  <li>A: pays off suppliers immediately</li>
  <li>B: has an extra $2 for 100 days.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>But this isn’t one box, one time. This is millions of boxes, all the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In reality, it’s more like “Company B has an extra, permanent $20MM.”</p>
<p>This concept works in both ways. We aren’t going to walk through it, but think about the inverse of Company B. That company would be paying its suppliers faster that it receives revenue. It would have a permanent hole of -$20MM.</p>
<h2>Working Capital Management</h2>
<p>This is the practice of working capital management (for most business, cash flow management is essentially working capital management). Cash managers, financial planners and raw materials buyers coordinate to maximize working capital and then deploy it productively.</p>
<p>I was explaining this, a friend said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“If you manage working capital well, you turn your business into a bank. You’re pooling excess capital and looking for ways to deploy it effectively.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s why I like you degens… you help us boomers see old concepts in new ways</p>
<p>Working capital becomes more important the more you understand it. Eventually you can use it to take over the world.</p>
<p>Proof? I did learned finance from men who’ve already done it with Net Working Capital &gt; $1B.</p>
