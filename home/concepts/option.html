<h1 style="text-align:center;">Options</h1>
<p>Options are a contract between two parties to buy/sell an asset (in the future) using a fixed price and date. At that future date, the option buyer has the choice whether to continue with the buy/sale; the seller does not.</p>
<p>Options are (usually) either Call or Put options.</p>
<h2>Call Options</h2>
<p>Call Option: the right, but not the obligation, to buy an asset in the future.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Eg ETH costs $1500 and you can purchase a call option on ETH at $1750. If the price of ETH is higher than $1750, you can exercise the option and buy ETH below market price.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Put Options</h2>
<p>Put Option: the right, but not the obligation, to sell an asset in the future.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Eg $ETH costs 1500 and you can purchase a put option on $ETH at $1250. If the price of ETH is lower than 1250, you can exercise the option and sell ETH above market price.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Premium</h2>
<p>The economic pin that this all revolves around is the premium. This is the fee paid by the buyer of the option to the seller of the option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The buyer will always pay and the seller will always receive the premium, regardless how the option settles.</p>
<h2>Option Styles</h2>
<p>Trad-Fi has two major styles of options: American and European.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both styles are similar, the key difference is the window in which the buyer may exercise the option.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>American options: exercise AT ANY TIME before expiry.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>European options: exercise ONLY AT expiry.</li>
</ul>
