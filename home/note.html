<h2>Introducing: Inevitable Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum is like religion: you cannot make a logical argument and convince someone to believe, you can only give them sacred truths and wait for them to experience enlightenment.</p>
<p>In May 2021, I had my epiphany when I heard <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hayden-adams-explains-uniswap-and-the-rise-of-defi/id1056200096?i=1000520421257">Hayden Adams explain Uniswap</a>. In a single podcast episode, I went from “internet dollars for internet dollars sake” to “the next inevitable, obvious step in thousands of years of human innovation.”</p>
<p>A giant leap forward.</p>
<p>This is a project dedicated to Ethereum, the World Computer. None of us can force the conversion moment on another person; it’s just not how this works. But some day, every single person is going to have their Hayden Adams-moment. This project is for that moment in every new convert’s journey.</p>
<p>The goal: create the materials to take your spark of interest and grow it into an all consuming fire. To show you the future that humanity is working towards; that we’ve been working towards every since we climbed down from the trees and stood upright. To show you that Ethereum is not only a big deal…</p>
<p>Ethereum is inevitable.</p>
